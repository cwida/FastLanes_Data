2015|69544350|2016-04-11|7178145|Rahel|Mein Freund und ich hatten gute gemütliche vier Nächte in Jans Studio. Es ist unfassbar ruhig und hat sogar ein gedämpftes Klavier für Leute die gerne spielen. Die Lage ist hervorragend und es gibt in der Strasse einen tollen alimentari und eine günstige weinerei. Das Bad ist sehr alt aber funktionstüchtig und der insgesamte Standard ist ok, ein wenig chaotisch aber dafür hat man das Gefühl man ist bei jemandem zuhause ! Jan ist ein aufgeschlossener lustiger Mann und auch um frische Handtücher und sonstiges bemüht! Wir danken.
2015|69990732|2016-04-15|41944715|Hannah|Jan was very friendly and welcoming host! The apartment was great and the area is sooo amazing, lots of nice cafes and shops! Enjoyed my time there a lot!
2015|71605267|2016-04-26|30048708|Victor|Un appartement tres bien situé dans un quartier historique de l'est tres agréable, le métro est tout proche. Pas de connexion internet ni de télé mais cela nous pousse encore plus a découvrir Berlin. Jan est tres accueillant et nous a donné quelques conseils pour nos visites.
2015|73819566|2016-05-10|63697857|Judy|It is really nice area, food, park, transport  are perfect! 
2015|74293504|2016-05-14|10414887|Romina|Buena ubicación, el departamento no está ordenado, acumula objetos en gran parte del mismo, no demasiado limpio, la mesa de luz es una caja de cartón. Faltan elementos básicos como una cafetera que se pueda utilizar. El anfitrión tuvo una actitud extraña, fue a dejar cosas y revisar el departamento mientras estábamos ahí.
2015|74690922|2016-05-16|39859815|Eil|Jan ist super flexibel und gut zu erreichen, wir konnten am Anreisetag auch schon deutlich vor eigentlichem Check-In Zeitpunkt in die Bude. Wohnung ist top gelegen, mitten in Mitte. Es ist alles da, es funktioniert alles. Wer keine Ansprüche an den optischen Zustand von Wohnung und Einrichtung hat, ist hier gut aufgehoben. 
2015|76603178|2016-05-28|29323516|Laurent|We had a very nice stay in Berlin, thanks to Jan's premium situated apartment. The place isn't big, but is quiet and functional, also it's situated in a perfect neighbourhood. Jan is a very welcoming host, eager to help you if needed or to provide you any kind of informations.

2015|82322683|2016-06-27|73902920|Mag|Apartment very well located, close to everything (supermarket, transport, city center). Very quiet nights because the apartment is located on the inside of the building. It has the basic equipment for one week stay. Jan is super accessible, nice and always available.
2015|85799408|2016-07-13|3862631|Lorenza|" My staying at Jan's was perfect: the apartment is exactly as described, is located in an amazing area, very easy to reach and close by many restaurants, bars, shops.
Jan was very helpful and friendly in giving all kind of tips: how to reach the apartment, good restaurants nearby etc.
Surely I would contact him again for my next stay in Berlin!"

Die Gegend (Prenzlauer Berg/Mitte) ist sehr ruhig. Jan ist ein netter, aufgeschlossener Mensch. Er ist sehr gut zu erreichen, falls man eine Frage hat oder noch etwas braucht.

2015|91549117|2016-08-05|69149181|Cassidy|Jan made us feel welcome in the apartment and in Berlin immediately. He gave us a guide type magazine, recommended restaurants, and told us about a website for public transport options. The apartment was clean, bright, and full of anything we needed during our stay.

El único 'pero' que le podríamos poner es la limpieza. Jan nos permitió un check-in temprano a las 14h00, lo cual le agradecemos infinito porque íbamos con dos niños pequeños. Fue quizá por esto que no le dio tiempo a limpiar algo más a fondo. En cualquier caso no es nada grave. "
2015|99043819|2016-09-03|3491950|Linda|Es war ein wirklich sehr schöner & angenehmer Aufenthalt und die Lage ist super. Ist auf jeden Fall zu empfehlen!
2015|100219314|2016-09-08|77152311|Roger|The location is perfect, the apartment is very quiet and close to public transport and many restaurants.  Jan was always available and quick to responding to any queries we had.  We stayed 4 nights but could easily have spent longer time in this apartment.  We recommend this for short or long stays for couples.
2015|102036781|2016-09-16|57900645|Alba|"El apartamento está situado en un barrio fantástico. Está muy cerca del centro, pero a la vez está en una zona tranquila y acogedora, con muchos restaurantes y bares alrededor. Además, muy bien conectado con el transporte público de Berlín.
El apartamento es tal y como se ve en las fotos, perfecto para dos personas. 
Si tengo que hacer una crítica negativa de mi estancia, es que no estaba todo lo limpio que esperábamos encontrarnos el alojamiento.

The location of the apartment was really good. Close to public transportation and in a really nice area. Jan was always responding to our messages and was willing to help us with anything we needed. Would definitely do it again! Thank you Jan.

2015|113207196|2016-11-11|49099447|Caryn|Great location in Mitte.  Jan's directions were helpful and the flat was easy to find.  The flat was perfect for 1 person with plenty of room for a couple.  Small kitchen but I never cooked in.  The weather was cold in Berlin but the airport was very cozy and always had hot water.  Quiet location and no street noise that I could hear.  Several restaurants and businesses within walking distance.  Easy walking distance to multiple trams and train station (Bernauer str).  Amazed at how much construction is happening in Berlin and in the neighborhood.  Berlin Wall memorial is an easy 10 minute walk.  Only suggestion is wine glasses and a bigger bath towel.  I would stay here again on my next visit to Berlin.
2015|114052519|2016-11-15|54663467|Costanza|the place is good, but we waited two hours the host and he didn't answer to our calls

2015|115270892|2016-11-23|28491374|Kate And Jayden|Jan was friendly and let us drop our bags off early. His place was clean, comfortable and in a great location, easily accessible to the train and tram
2015|117158383|2016-12-05|72313095|Valentina|"We booked a room for 3 guests on December the 1st. The apartment's pictures matched the reality except for the third bed which (to our surprise, upon arrival) wasn't actually a bed but a simple mattress layed on the floor. Quite uncomfortable and disappointing, considering we all paid the same amount per night.
Aside from that, the apartment was clean and Jan was very kind and helpful, he suggested us some places to go and allowed us to drop our luggages off earlier.
The area is quiet and safe, 3 mins walking distance from the tube station which will take you to the centre in 5 minutes."

2015|129485444|2017-01-31|100738267|Edward|Jan's place was very cosy, space efficient and ideal for our stay in Berlin. It was very clean, located very close to public transport and the neighbourhood was safe and peaceful. Jan was very helpful during our stay and we'd highly recommend his home!
2015|130036866|2017-02-04|9898347|Peiyi|"Jan's house was spacious for one/two travelers. It was near public transport and restaurants. It's about 1 hour away from the airport by public transport. I didn't meet Jan, because my friend checked in the accommodation for me.

However, he charges additional fees for a second person which I felt it didn't make sense, since the bed was a double bed and there really isn't anything ""extra"" provided for the second person, if you are talking about a towel that doesn't smell good or a blanket (which I think will be there whether there is one or two pax), or additional utilities (that wouldn't cost £25 a night). My friend decided to come up to Berlin to look for me last minute, just a day before and I was quite unhappy that he had taken money from my guest, and I felt really bad about it. I don't think £40 is a lot, but from the amount that I have already paid for a big room, my friend should be paying me instead for that bed space I'm sharing with him, which of cos I didn't ask any money from him. Unless my guest needed an additional bed, I don't think 1-2 pax really makes a big difference in the cleaning up of the room, or the utilities and the amenities since it was a 3 night stay for me. 

I would still recommend this place to fellow Airbnb members, cos it is comfortable and warm, just that I felt the communication part should have been better. "

2015|168864979|2017-07-10|38259296|Abraham|"Jan's apartment is the perfect mix of quiet retreat (the windows open into a central courtyard that is shielded from the street) and central location (the building is a few minutes walk from parks, multiple restaurant and shopping rich streets, and public transport).  It is also a 20 minute walk from Berlin's largest museums.  The surrounding neighborhood is very charming.  With a comfy large bed, full kitchen and bathroom, it has all the amenities a couple (or couple with a young kid) need for a long stay in Berlin, aside from a washer and dryer (but laundrymats are nearby). 

My partner and I spent 10 days here and it was great.  No complaints.  Fully recommended."

Jean was helpful, quick, and uncomplicated. I really enjoyed my stay.
2015|202448310|2017-10-11|4645752|Carol|This apartment is well situated in an interesting neighborhood and close to many options for public transportation. It is small, clean, and very well equiped for cooking and with ample space for storing clothes. It’s perfect for a short term stay in the city.

2015|240997396|2018-03-07|94775627|Valerij|Alles mehr als Bestens. Jan ist ein super Gastgeber, die Wohnung ist top und in einer außerordentlichen Lage.
2015|248019889|2018-03-30|160885950|Slavcho|"Excellent place. The flat is as it is on the pictures. Jan was a great host. He was right on time with the key as scheduled, gave me a tour of the flat, pointed out some interesting things about Berlin as well as places to see and do.

Great experience. Highly recommend."
2015|249605678|2018-04-02|42844776|Kathy|The place is in a great location close to loads of cafes, restaurants, and bars. Jan was flexible with our arrival time and held our bags for us. The bed is very comfortable and larger than I expected after looking at photos. Jan was very responsive when we messaged with questions and also offered some restaurant recommendations. The apartment is offset from the street so it was very quiet but the street is also quiet. I highly recommend this place!!
2015|252401419|2018-04-10|59805565|Tess|Quaint spot with everything I needed. Location was perfect for walking up the street to symposium. Host was very attentive and provided everything I might need, even a few snacks in the fridge. Great place, thanks again Jan!
2015|266542583|2018-05-20|180671688|Jana|"Ich habe diese schöne kleine Wohnung für meinen Sohn gebucht. Er suchte für einen längeren Zeitraum im April/Mai, für ein Praktikum in Berlin, ein Zuhause. Alles lief von Anfang bis Ende perfekt. Von der Kommunikation im Vorfeld, der Check-in Terminierung, dem freundlichen Empfang von Jan beim Ankommen, der Kommunikation während des Aufenthaltes (diskretes Nachfragen ob etwas gebraucht wird, etc.) bis zum Check-out lief alles freundlich und unkompliziert.
Die Wohnung liegt in einem schönen Stadtviertel, sehr zentral in Berlin. Man ist in wenigen Gehminuten an eine S/U oder Straßenbahnhaltestelle gelaufen. In nächster Nähe gibt es viele kleine Geschäfte, Lokale, Gaststätten bis zum großen Supermarkt.
Durch die Lage im Hinterhaus ist es in der Wohnung sehr ruhig. Die Wohnung ist für 2 Personen optimal, hat einen kleinen Flur, von wo es beim Reinkommen linkerhand in das Bad und geradeaus in das Wohn/Schlafzimmer und von da in die kleine Essküche geht. Sonst ist alles so wie auf den eingestellten Bildern zu sehen ist. Das Bett war beim Einzug bezogen, Handtücher lagen parat. Das Wlan funktioniert gut. Ich kann die Wohnung einfach nur weiter empfehlen."
2015|268444092|2018-05-25|26555763|Marie|This is a complete apartment unit with a nice kitchen and good room size. The location is very convenient. Some amenities could use improvement and overall the place could be cleaner (dust bunnies).
2015|269820853|2018-05-28|14264974|Habib|Solid place from which to explore Berlin. Has everything needed for a comfortable stay and well-located close to public transport and some main green areas, historic sites and shopping and cafe spaces. Jan was flexible and helpful at check-in & check-out, would stay here again.
2015|278944847|2018-06-19|117584318|Markus|Sehr angenehme, ruhige Wohnung. Wunderbarer Aufenthalt. Und Ian ist ein ausserordentlich netter und aufmerksamer Gastgeber.

2015|300481677|2018-08-02|63562767|Sabine|Perfekt! Optimale Lage, super zentral jedoch ruhig. Gemütliche Wohnung zwar klein aber mit allem was man braucht. Unkomplizierte Kommunikation und Check in, sehr hilfsbereit. Familienfreundlich, mein Baby und ich haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt, werden definitiv wiederkommen! 
2015|312774735|2018-08-24|14174325|Gagan|"Ian's place is in an excellent location, a quiet part of northern Mitte. It has everything you need - though I'll be honest I didn't use the kitchen.

On the flip side, the details are subpar. The pillows, sheets, blankets and towels could be either better chosen, more plentiful or refreshed more quickly. There is also some furniture and fixtures that are kind of on their last legs.

Ian is a very nice guy - accommodating and easy to communicate with. I really liked him.

There are limited last-minute options in Berlin so I'd stay here in a pinch but not if I had a few choices."
2015|320116480|2018-09-08|9944593|Michele|"Ian ci ha accolti nella sua casa all’ora stabilita, ci ha spiegato tutto nei minimi particolari, la casa è molto bella, pulita, vicino a vari mezzi di trasporto, negozi di alimentari, ristoranti, bar. 
La casa ha tutto quello che serve per viverci , se dovessimo tornare a Berlino sicuramente torneremo in questo appartamento!!"

2015|328401995|2018-09-26|107119185|Maxime|Ian was a great host. I appreciated the open communication. His place is great for people who are traveling for work or for young couples who are visiting Berlin. The accommodation is exactly as expected from the listing description. Also, the big bed is really cool! Thanks Ian.

2015|342093849|2018-10-28|29270141|Anna|"Die Kommunikation lief sehr schnell. Das war mir wichtig, da ich sehr kurzfristig gebucht hatte. Die Wohnung ist wirklich schön und ruhig, die Lage optimal. 
Alles war sehr sauber und besonders gut hat mir gefallen, dass übrig gebliebene Lebensmittel dort bleiben können. So hatte ich schon Tee und Kaffee zur Verfügung. "
2695|285580354|2018-07-04|30733089|Jason|"I really enjoyed staying at Micha and Nadja's place. It's a cosy ""real"" Berlin apartment. You can see it's one they use themselves when they're not on holiday, so I found this a very nice and authentic place to stay. It has everything you need and communication was very good and friendly, and they helped me out with lots of local tips. The area (and apartment itself) is quiet as they describe, but it's still quick and easy to get to the main areas I wanted to explore in Berlin. And it has a lot of places to eat out nearby. I plan to stay there again on my next Berlin holiday!"
2695|293495291|2018-07-20|97358801|Yingnan|Nadja, Michael & Jason were very friendly and helpful. The apartment is located in a nice and calm place with lots of good cafe, restaurant and supermarket nearby. Also with good public transport options. Immer gerne wieder!

2695|323902787|2018-09-16|28987255|Diana Marisol|The place was just as in the pictures which I always appreciate. The communication with Michael was always quick and he was open to arrange our arrival. Nadja received us when we arrived and showed us the house and the room. the place was very clean and the surroundings were quiet. I highly recommend this place when visiting Berlin!
2695|330940074|2018-10-01|31170444|Juliet|Our stay at Michael’s place was perfect for our time in Berlin. The train and bus stations were about a 15 minute walk away, with restaurants every few blocks. The space was cozy and I loved the funky decorations. We enjoyed our stay and would absolutely stay here again.
3176|4283|2009-06-20|21475|Milan|excellent stay, i would highly recommend it. a nice flat in a very nice area. Britta provided clear instructions in securing the keys, etc. Thanks again.
3176|134722|2010-11-07|263467|George|Britta's apartment in Berlin is in a great area.  There are numerous fantastic Restaurants and Bars to suit every taste, easy access to supermarkets and public transportation. The apartment is also surprisingly large.  I would surely stay there again.
3176|144064|2010-11-24|76726|Patricia|Fantastic, large place in good location. Only a short tram ride to Alexanderplatz U-S Bahn, with connections across Berlin. Britta was quick to reply to all messages and gave very clear instructions regarding directions, key pick up and things to know about the place. Try Gargerin cafe around the corner for lovely and cheap continental breakfast. I definitely recommend this apartment!
3176|156702|2010-12-21|291657|Benedetta|"L'appartamento di Britta è molto largo carino confortabile è in un quartiere molto tranquillo e comodo perchè ci sono tanti supermercati e bar dove poter mangiare. Siamo stati benissimo spero di ripetere la bellissima esperienza ... magari in estate!
ciao Benedetta"
3176|165048|2011-01-04|279789|Aude|"We went in Berlin for the new year eve. The appartment of Britta was really amazing, very chic, cool and in a good district !
You should go there !"
3176|169789|2011-01-12|49570|David + Tiila|Location, location, location! Britta's place was just what we needed when we visited Berlin. It is in a great hip area with tons of great independent designer boutiques, lovely restaurants and art galleries. When we arrived there was even a farmer's market just steps away from her door. She gave great directions to get to her place and her business partner was happily waiting there when we arrived. He gave us great suggestions on what to do in the city and sat down with us for about an hour explaining great walks and great places to see in Berlin. Her place was clean, tidy and everything that we needed to stay there for the three nights. If we ever get a chance to go to Berlin again, we would definitely stay here again!
3176|171371|2011-01-17|316682|Andy|"We were there to find out what life is like in the city so staying in someone's home was great and meant every minute added to our experience.  It couldn't have been more different than a touristy hotel.  Having Britta's books and pictures etc around us told us about contemporary life in prenslauer berg.  
The apartment is secure, comfortable and warm with lots of nice pieces of furniture and pictures. The location is ideal for shops, restaurants and interesting wandering.  Also very easy to get into town.  In fact we walked around a lot of Berlin from the door.  "
3176|189772|2011-02-28|363617|Björn|Recommended! Nice, informative and easy to deal with.  Beautiful flat in great location.

3176|206258|2011-03-22|379479|Aurélie|Britta's flat was perfect for our week end in Berlin. it was nice, located in a nice area (with shops/market/restaurant/bars) and ideal to visit Berlin. I recommend it
3176|213252|2011-03-30|204382|Chafic|I really enjoyed staying at this flat. It was in a great location, very charming and spacious apartment. The host arranged to have everything ready and we had no issues. I'd definitely stay there again. Thanks a lot for making our trip to Berlin enjoyable!
3176|229624|2011-04-18|32292|Merel|I had a great weekend in Berlin with 3 friends and the fabulous flat of Britta had a big role in that. The location is great, nearby nice restaurants and pubs, nearby a bike rent shop and nearby the public transport. No complaints about the appartment, I would recommend it to anyone. And no complaints about the host too, she is very flexibel. I will book Britta's flat again if I go back to Berlin!
3176|257943|2011-05-10|52588|Judy|We really enjoyed staying at britta's appartement. It was clean  and cosy! It is located in a really nice neighbourhood! When we come back to berlin we would definatly stay at britta's  appartement, which already feels like home!  
3176|311329|2011-06-13|554648|Jim|Britta's flat is in a great location in a really lovely part of Berlin, close to transport links taking you into the centre in minutes. Pleny of cafes and restaurants on the door step and a great farmers market. All communication with Britta was great. We hope to to return! 
3176|320095|2011-06-18|364801|Elizabeth|Lovely apartment in a great location. My only complaint would be that the building is very noisy--every step up and down the stairs is quite audible. Other than that a pleasant stay. 
3176|341827|2011-06-29|391196|Paul|"This flat is in one of the nicest areas of Berlin, surrounded by cafes, bars and independent shops. Very easy for transport links to anywhere in the city, also walkable distance to Alexanderplatz and the fantastic shopping area which surround the TV Tower.
The flat itself is as described, fabulous. Beautiful furniture and very well equipped with everything you could possibly need during your stay. 
Britta, as a host, was very friendly and prompt in all communications.
I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone planning a trip to Berlin.

Thanks a lot. 
Berlin, we miss you!!!"
3176|349434|2011-07-03|108807|M&J|Britta's place is wonderful! We was very comfortable in this flat.Awesome neighborhood(market,caffee, shop...) and really easy to find Britta's place!

3176|374351|2011-07-15|98754|Jesper|We had a great stay in Brittas apartment. We were a family of four, and the kids had plenty of space, plus the location has to be one of the best in Prenzlauer Berg, right next to many caffees and restaurants, plus a great park with a very good playground. So perfect for families, but also spacious and nice for couples.
3176|390001|2011-07-23|341839|Charlotte|We had a great stay in this vibrant, historic neighbourhood. Appartment is large and comfortable. 
3176|517600|2011-09-10|838113|Philip|We were visiting Berlin with a friend , for the fist time , to visit our son and his wife who have just moved there . The flat was in a perfect location for sightseeing and well located for local restaurants and bars . A very well maintained flat and very comfortable for three people or possibly even four . this time we did not eat in the flat at all but it certainly seemed to be well provided with all necessary equipment to do so and local shops offered very good variety of food including plenty of organic stuff for those who want it . All in all a very successful trip and we would highly recommend the flat .
3176|549671|2011-09-20|87328|Danielle|"Hi there, 

Our host, Britta, was very accommodating and patient! There was someone to introduce us to the place, give us keys and the lay of the land as soon as we arrived.  The apartment was just as expected in a great neighborhood. We were really comfortable and had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again next time I visit Berlin!

Best, 
Danielle"
3176|593976|2011-10-03|1169367|Tanis|"I thought this was a great apartment in a fabulous location.  The place was large and had everything we needed.  Maarten and Britta were very helpful with all the arrangements.  And you couldn't walk two feet from the apartment without finding a patio for coffee, drinks or delicious brunch!
"
3176|760171|2011-12-03|641003|Morten|I stayed in this cosy apartment, which is beautifully situated in Prenzlauer Berg, for 7 weeks. The apartment was all it promised and more to. Britta, the landlady, and Marcus the contact in Berlin were both very pleasant to deal with and made it a very nice stay. I would highly recommend the apartment to anyone considering staying in Berlin.   
3176|822028|2012-01-02|569782|Myriam|"We had a fantastic and very comfortable stay at Btitta's and Maarten's spacious place. The apartment offers everything you need and was everything it was promised to be. The location is very central and quite in the midst of things and we enjoyed roaming the streets in the area. 
Bakeries, bars, cafés, restaurants, clubs, supermarkets, clothing shops, pharmacies, anything you name it, are all near by. Above all, Britta was extremly helpful and communication was great and easy, too.
We would definitely love to come and stay again."
3176|877618|2012-01-23|803673|Ruben|Perfect location, very central and beautiful neighbourhood. Check-In and out was easy, communication very uncomplicated. Clean & well equipped  flat.

3176|930149|2012-02-19|1450830|Holger|Excellent appartment in great neighbourhood. Stayed there for 10 days with our little daughter (Prenzlauer Berg with it's Kindercafés, playgrounds etc. is ideal for kids). We enjoyed our time there very much and hope to return to this charming place soon.
3176|1380765|2012-05-30|1383050|Erika|Great apartment in an absolutely fabulous neighborhood! Plus Britta's an excellent host -- extremely helpful and quick to respond to anything and everything you need. Check in and check out was also super easy. I absolutely loved the month I spent here! The place has everything you'd need. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone. Spacious and quiet, yet in the midst of tons of great cafés and restaurants! Would definitely  stay here again.
3176|1483296|2012-06-15|1131070|Yamil|Berlin in itself is a wonder of a place with opportunities in all fields of arts and culture! Now, you add that to a great apartament in one of the most special neighborhoods, great street fair, great bars and restaurants, easy access by tram (M2)  or subway (U2) and all youl have is a great stay. Besides, you can be sure that Martin, Britta and their home caretakers ( in our case Marcus ) will be always a hand, before, during and after your stay to give you assistance and hints. Sandra, my wife, will certainly return if we have another chance.
3176|1608161|2012-07-02|368650|Debra|This apartment is wonderful and is located in one of tne most beautiful neighborhoods in Berlin. My husband and I loved the apartment and were very sad when we had to leave. Everything was very comfortable and you could not ask for a better location. We made sure to see other areas as well (Charlottenberg, Kreuzberg, F'Schein, etc), and nothing compares to the lovliness of this section of Prenzlauer Berg. It is our hope that we can find an apartment just like Britta's so that we can spend more time in Berlin.
3176|1651302|2012-07-07|1143715|Daniel|I´ve been coming to Berlin twice a year for the past 3 years or so, this has been by far the best accommodation i´ve had in this city. It is truly a beautiful apartment  in a perfect location close to many good cafes and restaurants. There's also one of the best bio supermarkets i´ve been to just a short walk from the place, and a 10 min walk to the busier areas in Mitte. Everything was on point, and it was very easy to check it and out.  Definitely looking forward to returning. 
3176|1847553|2012-07-31|2146828|Sven|"We spent one week in Berlin at this amazing flat in a simply wonderful location. With a daughter of 16months old, Prenzlauer Berg I would say is the perfect place to enjoy Berlin whilst allowing your child to explore what seemed to be a sandpit on every corner of every block! 
Equally as adults we enjoyed the amazing choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood. We did travel to other areas of this vast sprawling city, but could'nt wait to get back to the calmness of this light and airy flat and its tree lined surroundings! We would most definitely recommend staying in this apartment. We would love to come back and stay here again and explore this fantastic city! "
3176|2055840|2012-08-21|2482248|Greg|"This was our first Airbnb experience. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in a beautiful clean, light, stylish apartment. 100 times better than staying in a hotel. Our hosts were great to deal with.

Its a great neighbourhood with incredible restaurants and it was really lovely to pop around the corner on Saturday morning and see the farmers market.

Highly recommended."
3176|2302798|2012-09-17|1647441|John|This is a great flat to be based in while exploring Berlin.  It's location is perfect - close to the trams and walking distance from many central locations.  The flat itself is spacious and relaxed in style.  It was the ideal place to come back to at the end of a busy day.  
3176|2345315|2012-09-19|3245173|Anna|Wonderful large, clean and airy apartment in one of my favourite parts of Berlin. Loved the neighbourhood, so easy to get around and way better than staying in a hotel. Only thing I would add is it would be nice to be able to leave bags there on check out day. We had to check out at 11am which seemed quite early and as we weren't flying the the evening it would have been nice to have the option for a late check out, or somewhere to leave bags in the building
3176|2460574|2012-09-30|380042|Beck|"The apartment was great, couldn't have been happier. The neighbourhood has lots of character/lots going on but is still peaceful to go to sleep at night. 10-15 minute walks to be in the heart of the action and really close to the train and tram systems. The apartment has great space (could easily hold a small family or 4 people if using the day bed) and has lovely natural light all throughout. 
Communication with Maarten was incredible, he always got back to us really quickly and kindly arranged a last minute booking late at night. 
If I go back to Berlin I'd definitely try and get this place again.
Thanks Maarten (and Britta and Marcus.)"
3176|2724652|2012-10-26|2721587|Dominique|We really enjoyed our Short break holiday in Berlin and this beautiful flat was certainly part of it. We couldn't have picked a better flat. It is exactly as described. It is located on the first floor and we thought it was very quiet and very homely. We had tons of space for the two of us. The bed is also very comfortable (I have a dodgy back). The location was perfect. We were spoilt for choice regarding restaurants or cafés as there are about 10 (more even?) just around the house : we did like Endlos (leaving the house, turn left and cross the road). The underground station is only 5 minutes away, the tram to Alexander Platz is at the end of the road. Or Alexander Platz itself is only a 10-15 minute stroll. From there you can travel anywhere in the city. We found that we could walk to a lot of landmarks (Brandenburger Tor, Dom, Reichstag etc.) very easily. The supermarket (organic) is down the road (turn left and walk for about 2-3 minutes). In a nutshell we loved it and we'd definitely be back. 
3176|2822785|2012-11-07|1225017|Tijn & Corinne|"The location off the apartment is the best, smack in the middle of all the action: bars / restaurants / shops. The apartment self is nice and spacious the only things what we missed was a coffee-machine, so you didn't have to get dressed to go outside to get our first coffee, a little radio would have been nice also, just to bring some liveliness in to the apartment. And 1 roll of toilet-paper for 4 days isn't enough ;-)  Contact with Maarten & Britta and there manager Marcus was strict and business. And sorry guys 10 am check out is way to early. 
Greetz Tijn & Corinne"
3176|3034592|2012-12-06|3058826|Tawny|"We had a fantastic month in this apartment. It is in a great, picturesque, safe area of Berlin. It seemed that every time we needed something it was just around the corner. There is a great organic supermarket down the road. Markets, restaurants, cafes and parks, and the metro and tram are all really close and everything is easy to get to.
All our communication with Britta and Maarten, and Marcus, was quick and easy and they were always very helpful. The apartment itself could not have been better. It is really peaceful, light and roomy and has everything we needed. Comfortable beds, plenty of space to put away all our stuff and lots of spare towels and linen were really appreciated. It was very cosy and warm in the heart of winter too. Basically we never wanted to leave. "
3176|3127467|2012-12-21|3381897|Lillian|We appreciated the flexible check in/out times, the baby books, play pen, and high chair for our 11-month old baby. We walked to many places - Lucia Christmas Market, Mauerpark, Sunday Flea Market, Farmer's Market (just steps from the front door), Konnopke's (currywurst), Mamay (friendly service and delicious Vietnamese food) and Alexanderplatz. The flat was comfortable, warm and cozy. Instructions were straightforward. We stayed a week but wished we could have stayed longer.
3176|3426764|2013-01-28|4465575|Idil|the place was so good I think. first we came we saw that the house is more little than what we see in photos. but it's not a problem. the location of the house is perfect. the street is beautiful. it is positioned between a restaurant and a cyrstal store. when you see the house you can easily understand that it has a nice and sympathetic energy with all its little details. (objects, furnitures, plants.. etc)  if you want to have a good vacation in Berlin in a nice house, I think this place will be a good one to had cheery times with friends that make you feel like home.
3176|3787173|2013-03-15|2635427|Ahmet|It was a perfect stay, everything was like the pictures shown on airbnb and every detail in the house was vibrating with a good energy :) Britta and Marcus were very helpful, we felt home, thank you very much for everything, hope to stay again.
3176|4494680|2013-05-08|3649916|Guillaume|Britta’s flat was the perfect place for us to discover Berlin. The flat is quite, with character and perfectly situated just near Kolwillplatz where you can start the day with a perfect brunch. We found Prenzlauer Berg was one of the most charming neighbourhoods in Berlin but it’s easy, as we did, to rent bikes around the corner or take the tram/metro within a short walking distance to explore the other parts of the city. Preparatory communication by email with Britta was straightforward and clear and Marcus welcomed us simply and nicely despite our late arrival, helping us to really enjoy our stay.
3176|5330123|2013-06-24|6790430|David|"A very nice place in a very nice neighbourhood. 
Great moment! Thanx!!"
3176|6040823|2013-07-28|4780929|Henrik|"The flat is a perfect place for a visit to Berlin. It is in an excellent location, super cosy and close to all the best places in Prentzlauer Berg - and only 5 minutes from subway (U-bahn) and shopping/ supermarkets.
The owner, Britta, is very freindly and we would very much recommend her place to others. We stayed 2 adults and 2 kids in the apartment, and it is perfect for kids as well."
3176|6812133|2013-08-26|93069|Iwona|"Britta's flat is located around the corner from Kollwitz Platz, a beautiful part of Berlin. Our toddler had loads of playgrounds to explore. We had a choice of cafes and restaurants. The flat was lovely and had all what one needs to stay for a week. 
Highly recommend! "
3176|7032970|2013-09-04|1704573|Ian McR|"We fully endorse the description of the flat as being a ""Fabulous Flat in a Great Location"". We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the flat, the appointments within the flat ere very sensitive to the needs of travelers, particularly when staying for quite a few days.

We thought that the location of the flat provided many opportunities for getting out and about easily, as well as a great selection of local restaurants; especially the Cafe Water Tower, only two doors down from the flat.

Well done, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!!.

3176|8250944|2013-10-22|3829461|Shae|The flat is in a great neighborhood with lots of coffee/breakfast/dinner/bike rental and weekend markets right within 1-3 blocks of the flat. U-Bahn is about a 3-5min walk, 3-5 blocks from the door. Only thing could have made our stay better would have been a nicer bed and a place to hang clothes. Other than that, the apartment was great. It has everything you need and we'd definitely recommend a stay there. 
3176|8991177|2013-12-01|177866|Liz|"I stayed in this wonderful flat for 5.5 weeks in Fall, 2013.  The keyholder was very helpful in explaining the apartment and neighborhood.
It is in a great location.  Prenzlauer Berg is an attractive residential area with a nice family atmosphere.  The Thursday and Saturday markets on Kollwitz Platz are only steps away.  And the area is full of good restaurants and cafes.
The apartment itself has public transportation, grocery stores, ATMs within walking distance for a convenient urban experience.
Although the neighborhood bubbles with activity, the apartment is  quiet.
I'm looking forward to my next stay in this apartment!"
3176|9345018|2013-12-23|925316|Margot|The apartment was exactly as the pictures and very clean. The neighbourhood is one of my favourites around the world. Me and my sister had a lovely time in Berlin. Great shopping, great sightseeing, lovely food en great markets all around. There just a minor thing to mention, if you stay here with someone you like but you don't want to sleep lepeltje-lepeltje (Dutch expression for sleeping really close to each other), the bed could be too small so someone has to sleep in the daybed, which is fine but in the living room. This worked well for me and my sister. 
3176|9462277|2013-12-30|9145967|Catherine|"We had a fantastic time staying in this flat - a great spot and so close to Mitte. Great area for shopping and restaurants. It was so easy to get anywhere from here, and the flat was lovely.
Thanks.

3176|9788279|2014-01-10|4579681|Katie|Britta's place is gorgeous and in a fantastic location. All the amenities are high quality; good shower, very comfy bed, fast wifi, effective heating (necessary in January).  Would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in PB.
3176|9927702|2014-01-20|7956718|Julien|"As mentioned by other reviewers before, the flat is very well-located, a few metro/tram stations away from the historical centre of Berlin. Everything was great, the flat was very comfortable, fast wifi, good heating, nice decoration. We came with our one-year old daughter and Britta provided a highchair as well as a baby cot. So that was very good for us.
There is a great organic supermarket as well as a REWE close to SenefelderPlatz U-bahn station.
Overall, we highly recommend this flat.

3176|11555558|2014-04-07|5890843|Marion|"Best location in Prenzlauer Berg surrounded by many good restaurants. There are many playground for children near by and it is very easy to discover Berlin from there.
The appartement itself is very cosy and the kitchen is fully equipped with what you need.
The bed in the bedroom is a bit small for two people. So one of us ended up sleeping in the livingroom on the daybed, but I was pregnant.

3176|15153837|2014-07-03|13602623|Norbert|Schöne Wohnung in noch schönerer Lage. Alles bestens gelaufen!
3176|15324866|2014-07-07|248353|Courtney|The apartment was is the perfect location in Prenslauer Berg. So many great restaurants and shops to choose from. The apartment itself  was nice and they were able to provide a crib and high chair. The water heater went out twice. The first time a plumber was sent and the second time we were able to reset the pilot light ourselves. The lack of hot water was inconvenient, especially with a baby, but Britta and her management company were helpful and responsive. This was the first AirBnB property I have stayed in (over 20x) that was run by a service rather than a host who was present. We paid an extra 20€ for arriving after 9PM. Overall, I loved the location and Britta was nice and communicative but I would likely stay elsewhere in the neighborhood next time. 
3176|16138222|2014-07-22|15098169|Mariette|We stayed in this very nice apartment in the best neighbourhood in Berlin (or so we think). Dining, bars and shopping is all in walking distance and the Saturday morning market is just around the corner. We would definitely stay here again!
3176|16451800|2014-07-28|3462312|Annemiek|"The appartement was great! Clean, big and comfortebel. We loved the area also. Lots of good restaurants, nice parks and friendly people.
The baker underneath the appartment is a nice man and his bread is delicious!
Hope to come again."

3176|17964940|2014-08-19|434844|Joel|We had a pleasant stay in the apartment which really has a top location near Kollwitzplatz. Rebecca was very helpful and provided a baby cot bed and high chair for the little ones.

3176|19029533|2014-09-05|6735687|Jenni|Our family had a great stay at Britta's lovely apartment which worked well for two adults + a baby. The neighbourhood is perfect for children (parks, lots of kids etc.), and caters for the parents too (nice cafes, restaurants, shops...). Mitte, Volkspark Friedeichshain are within walking distance. Thanks, Britta - we're planning to come back! 
3176|19208706|2014-09-08|17924567|Alexander|Fantastic location. The market on saturday in front of the door is just amazing. One just goes out and is in the middle of action. The apartment was as described, we felt us very comfortable there. The chair was my personal favorite. Last  but not least: there were some tea we could have! I couldn't wish more.  Britta and team, thank you very much for your hospitality! Would love to stay in your flat again.
3176|19533661|2014-09-14|12684992|Femke|Clean and well decorated appartement. Fellt like home. Beautiful neighbourhood with good restaurants. We definitely want to stay here again.
3176|19767627|2014-09-18|14525162|Archana|"Britta's flat was a cozy & comfortable place.. It had a fantastic location with cafes and shops within 5-10 minutes walking distance from the apartment .. 8-10 minute tram ride to the city centre (Alexander Platz) .. she was away when we arrived, however Ian checked us in and we loved Britta's recommendations of Cafe Anna Blume for sumptuous cakes and coffee and the organic supermarket close to the apartment , in addition to things to do in the city ...
We would definitely stay in the apartment if we return to Berlin .."
3176|20832496|2014-10-06|8286827|David|"Lovely, spacious apartment in a perfect location.
We really enjoyed our time here. Check in was straight forward and the apartment was great. It's in one of the older parts of town and has a lot of character.
We'd very happily stay here again.
If you're here on a Sunday make sure to head to Mauerpark!"

3176|23073556|2014-11-22|18280391|Sarah|"We had a good welcome from Rebecca who helps to manage the apartment and, although the flat had not been cleaned from the previous let when we arrived, this was quickly sorted and Britta phoned to apologise.  Britta supplied very helpful directions to find the apartment from Tegel Airport and there was an abundance of local maps and guide books to sift through to plan our sightseeing while in Berlin for only two days.  The flat is delightful and a bit quirky, warm and comfortable.  We were even more impressed to have a supply of tea and coffee which we had forgotten to buy!
The apartment is in a quiet neighbourhood but with easy access to central areas.  Lots of good eateries, bars and cafes nearby and a great Saturday market just up the street.  Warmly recommended."
3176|23221649|2014-11-25|23377532|Kasia|"Beautiful flat which felt like home. Everything was as described. The flat was well equipped, bright, warm and cosy. The location was perfect, central but incredibly quiet. We were met and greeted by someone from Berlin Cribs who explained everything to us. Britta was great at answering all my texts and queries before arrival and I would definately stay there again.  
Thank you"
