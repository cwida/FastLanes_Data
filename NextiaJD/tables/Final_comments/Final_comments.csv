The chat request function also seems buggy which is frustrating. Having said all that, there are honestly plenty of really amazing listeners available, if you persevere (all stars are for them!). There are brief self-help guides available on various topics - they can be hit and miss, and should be taken with a grain of salt, or simply as introductions.|4|4|4.6.9|2020-05-29 18:56:28|Hello Christine, Thank you for your feedback.

Seriously though, FIX THE UI. It's very hard to navigate. 1 issue that I have is that you can't view your profile (well if you can I can't find the option!). If you make a post, then people respond to it but you accidentally delete the notification, how can you view it? There must be a place where you can review all your contributions to the community like Reddit. Go to profile, then you can view all posts and comments. Where is this feature?!

Therapist great but the platform is terrible. It censors what I say to the therapist. We have put in numerous complaints but it doesn't get fixed. The text box for messaging therapist is so small you can't properly review what you have written, messages go missing. Notifications have ceased. The web version is better than this app, but that isn't good. Don't get the app. The concept is good and they have great work sheet type resources. The support spaces seemed helpful but the strange aliases people made it alienating for me. non-therapy messaging systems are also clumsy. Can't message another member directly. The Listeners, unqualified volunteers, are variable in quality, and members have many horror stories. I had trouble finding a useful one in my time zone.
