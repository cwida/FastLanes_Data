3|1|A lot of twitter apps (including mine) can make use of hovercard to display user info. I would use it as soon as it becomes available!|Nischal Shetty|2010-04-01|1
4|1|Worked a minute ago, now it&#8217;s pulled|Jonah Grant|2010-04-01|1
5|1|Yep. At 10:33pm pst it is down. I get an &#8220;index of&#8221; page. 20 minutes is a pretty good response time on their part. Only wish I had been faster. Thanks for the screenshots!|Joshua Guffey|2010-04-01|1
6|1|Now it&#8217;s down!I love &#8220;view source&#8221; option on browser|Tom|2010-04-01|1
7|1|So basically @anywhere is just an Oauth login system, just like my facebook-connect or Google Friends Connect? What&#8217;s the added value?First with OpenID and Oauth people are told they only need 1 login to get everywhere. Now it seems I have to decide wheter to use my google, twitter or facebook account to do this&#8230;. I still miss something|Erik|2010-04-01|1
8|1|second, this looks exactly like facebook connect, the only cool thing is the rollover, but even that isn&#8217;t that cool.|Andrew Furman|2010-04-02|1
9|1|Both brings login with their credentials, and post back to the mothership (Facebook or Twitter). Anything else though, because it sounds more phenomenal than that when announced.|Seika|2010-04-02|1

13|1|This doesn&#8217;t appear to have any functionality beyond what&#8217;s available currently through twitter&#8217;s oauth API. The exception is the hover card, although this could certainly be built with the current API and a little javascript.While this is certainly to do with @anywhere it makes me wonder how twitter will handle third party competition with this service &#8211; will they add terms to the API to stop people competing, or will they remove or limit certain methods. Either way, it&#8217;s a worry.|James|2010-04-02|1

49|11|Like what?  The HP Slate?  Really?Before you all complain about everything you think you need that Apple wont let you have, maybe you should look at what is out or coming for this device.  It has already met a lot of what I really want in a tablet.  Comics, Astronomy Software, VNC client, Netflix, RDP, excellent email client (not like the crap that comes with Android), fun games, drawing software, note taking, and a great web browser. I don&#8217;t need Final Cut Studio or XCode on a tablet (or want it).Thank God the success of this product is not dependent on the approval of us geeks.|yarsrvenge|2010-04-01|1
50|11|ok, i was with you until you said &#8220;not like the crap that comes with android&#8221;. now if you want to clarify and say you meant the IMAP, generic mail client and not the Gmail app, i can jive with that. But if by some craziness you mean the native gmail client&#8211;you&#8217;re insane. the gmail app is by far (and a wide berth at that) the -best- mobile mail app i&#8217;ve ever seen. the fact that they&#8217;ve crammed every feature on the desktop version into something that fits into my pocket AND has a unified inbox is no small feat.otherwise i concur with what you&#8217;re saying. and for disclosure i have a nexus one next to me and an ipad somewhere in hong kong at the moment.|Scot|2010-04-01|1
51|11|Why is it that Android users never complain that the only good IMAP client on the Nexus One is the gMail client?Isn&#8217;t tying your Android to a gMail address just as bad as tying your iPhone to a MobileMe address?  Shouldn&#8217;t any IMAP address work like gMail on Android?|jimmy|2010-04-01|1
52|11|I wouldn&#8217;t say no to final cut or premiere on the iPad. Hell, it might even talk me into buying one.|Dashiell Menard|2010-04-01|1
53|11|It&#8217;s possible the A4 includes additional security features in its SoC that will make disabling the iPhone OS&#8217; kernel security features more difficult. But even if jailbreaking were able to turn the iPad into an Android-like experience, what would be the attraction of running next year&#8217;s Chrome OS, which is nothing more than a browser? Does anyone really want to buy a $500 device just to sit around playing Farmville? And if so, shouldn&#8217;t you hope the iPad can&#8217;t be jailbroken so there is some remaining reason for somebody to buy an actual Chrome OS tablet, or the failed results of the CrunchPad effort, or a Courier or Slate PC? Flash is all they got. Give that to Apple and they can&#8217;t really tout anything.|Daniel Eran Dilger|2010-04-01|1

55|11|No-one is forcing you to buy the iPad, Devin. You know the score. It&#8217;s an Apple product that is both innovative and limited. It&#8217;s the Zen that makes Apple what it is: rightly or wrongly.The iPad hits a sweet spot for consumers who want to browse the Web, read books, access their apps and email, and play games. Most are unlikely to miss accessing &#8220;obscure file formats&#8221; or DOS games.The multi-touch capability is the key way to navigate. Apple are unlikely to have ever considered allowing &#8220;multiple wireless controllers&#8221;, which takes away from the simplicity of the device.The iPad is part of the Apple ecosystem and you purchase it on that basis. It is wasteful to lament that you have to download apps and multimedia content via iTunes.Apple is about providing beautiful end-to-end solutions that lead to you accusing the corporation of being a &#8220;control freak&#8221;, but Apple isn&#8217;t interested in accommodating every man and his dog.The idea of running a touch-enabled ChromeOS or other netbook OS is tantalising though. I&#8217;m sure a touch-enabled Mac OS X will find its way into the iPad eventually. Why wouldn&#8217;t it? Apple have to remain competitive and giving fuller functionality will be part of keeping up or ahead of the game as manufacturers release their own versions of iPad.I guess within 4 years we&#8217;ll see Mac OS X or OS XI on the iPad in some form.|Delacroix|2010-04-01|1
56|11|You are free to purchase it on the basis of the Apple ecosystem, and be content with it, as I&#8217;m sure millions will be, but I sure won&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m very far afield here in wanting more freedom with the device than Apple chooses to include. Once I&#8217;ve bought it, I&#8217;ll use it however I like, and I look forward to the possibilities.|Devin Coldewey|2010-04-01|1
57|11|I&#8217;m pretty sure if Apple sold the $499 iPad without benefiting from revenue streams related to the sale of applications or accesssories for it, they would be losing money on it.  I think their marketing department determined that $499 was the right price point to get the iPad in the hands of mainstream consumers.  They need this thing to hit mass purchase volume to justify the low cost.  It only make sense they did everything possible to steer us to their iTunes store to spend more money on apps.|Ash|2010-04-01|1

73|77|We&#8217;ve owned Olympus Stylus cameras for a few years, and while the image quality is nowhere near as good as my DSLR (and I would not expect it to be), it is perfect for the backyard pool or at the beach.  They&#8217;ve been dropped, submerged (intentionally and otherwise) and tossed around and have always worked perfectly.  I just picked up a Kodak Playsport ($150 @ Amazon) for the same circumstances and have so far been impressed by the video quality and image stabilization.|Steven Eppinger|2010-03-30|1

75|77|The Kodak Playsport is the closest I have to that. I&#8217;m a fan of it, and the underwater video is pretty solid.

78|77|Devin, you are so weak on testing these &#8216;ruggidized&#8217; cameras.  The true test? Give one of these to my wonderful, sweet, 19 year old teenage daughter who is;The most feared, loathed and hated by iPhones and cameras worldwide- The thrilla and teenage- phonezilla. I believe she is on iPhone #3 in 18 months and 5 camera in 3 yrs.  I ALWAYS buy the Xtended warranty- paid off so many times I lost count. She is careful, responsible but stuff just happens when your a teenager- fell into toilet, slid off hood of car, fell out of pocket while climbing into boat and lastly, fell out of my Bikini (what???)while I was carrying drinks!

82|77|dropping it in water says NOTHING about whether these are suitable for scuba diving.  Remember, 33 feet of water equals an entire atmosphere&#8217;s worth of pressure.  The commonly accepted sport diving limit is almost 4 times that depth, i.e. a total of 5 atmospheres of pressure.  The diving around Seattle&#8217;s pretty great, so find someone who will take them down and test them at their stated limits, OK?|JFS|2010-04-01|1
83|659|This suit does seem to be a little more like extortion than the others. They did break the rules and yelp has the right to remove the content. I&#8217;m gonna have to side with yelp on this one.|Dennis|2010-03-04|1
84|659|Silly Question here, why can&#8217;t Yelp run their website ANY way they want?Why can&#8217;t Yelp remove people if they don&#8217;t advertise, its not like Yelp is the only search engine, I think google is still the largest, plus most people use google maps and search for resto&#8217;s that way.Who really trust Yelp reviews anyway. I trust friends on Facebook more, not some a-hole on yelp.|eTraveler|2010-03-04|1
85|659|Yelp can run any it wants.  But Yelp cannot try to torpedo businesses.  If the business doesn&#8217;t want to advertise with them, and they want to remove the business from it&#8217;s database, thats all good.  But you cannot just remove all the positive reviews and leave the negative ones.  Then it looks like a mafia protection racket.|Brian|2010-03-05|1

And yet the company can not remove themselves from the website and are forced to take other action to seek justified recourse.|Amanda O.|2010-03-18|1

93|659|Nothing merit-less about it.  I know personally of one business client that had positive reviews removed after he stopped paying for advertising.  He was very pissed-off.   And it happened immediately after he stopped paying Yelp.|danny007|2010-03-04|1
94|659|I&#8217;d encourage my customers to leave reviews as well.  I don&#8217;t see an issue with that unless they demanded ONLY positive reviews.|yo|2010-03-04|1
95|659|seems like good business to ask people to review, tweet or do a video about there experience|Gebadia Smith|2010-03-04|1
96|659|+110%- I ask all of my clients to do testimonials and tell all their friends.  I reward them as well as word of mouth is most important.Yes, anyone can buy there way onto a site- what if business simply opened a dozen email accounts and posted?  Just like in online gaming- paid &#8216;hords&#8217; go out and post on blogs and promote within various social networks- you can never stop this.I understand Yelp&#8217;s hope that they have unsolicited reviews posted about businesses but 100%? Never.|Dave Hanna|2010-03-05|1
97|659|Also, soliciting reviews in general is good for Yelp.  More users = more reviews = more dominance in the check in game.|Brian|2010-03-05|1
98|659|Did the business client solicit the positive reviews?  Interesting issue.  If Yelp had open comments and you had to pay to remove bad comments, they would seem to have an argument since could say we don&#8217;t touch comments, but if you pay us, will get someone to take care of it for you.Here the complaint is a business solicited comments and Yelp yanked saying its against policy.  They have an argument if they want open unsolicited user generated comments.  Yelp&#8217;s argument is less clear if they only yank solicited comments if business fails to pay.However, although Yelp&#8217;s practice, if true, might make their comments/reviews less useful, not sure amounts to a legal case of extortion.  Should be interesting to see how courts handle.|jb|2010-03-04|1
99|659|Simpley put&#8230; the business had about 11 positive reviews to begin with (I was one of the positive reviewers).  The owner decided to advertise to increase business.  After he stopped, Yelp removed about 9 reviews &#8212; he was left with only 2 positive reviews (zero negative).This could be a case of one or two rogue sales people, but I doubt it.|danny007|2010-03-04|1
100|659|Review sites are a tough thing.  Yelp&#8217;s reputation is everything to them.  Although there hasn&#8217;t been that many reviewers on http://www.baduku.com/, it&#8217;s been interesting to see the slow growth and the opinions coming in.|Patrick Chang|2010-03-04|1

104|659|Sounds like Yelp! has some bad apples wandering around the office, but this suit doesn&#8217;t really have any merit.  This article should note that the spa was never asked for money in exchange for anything.  They simply got a few sales calls, and reviews that they admit were solicited were taken down.  This suit doesn&#8217;t even allege that they were extorted, it points to other people who were alleged to have been extorted.  Doesn&#8217;t make any sense.  Dime store lawyer.|Luke|2010-03-04|1
105|659|If it is true it really is not all that surprising&#8230; Zynga got CEO of the year for scamming users&#8230; no morals online|Gebadia Smith|2010-03-04|1
106|659|Yelp&#8217;s reverting true to form: keep extorting customers, keep denying the facts everyone knows, keep thinking no one&#8217;s going to figure out the scam.The real irony?  They were right on the cusp of taking off BIG.  They were poised to be the inheritor from craigslist, the place everyone knows where to go to find local services.Lots of other companies have been there.  The ones that survived and went on to greatness, made a commitment to deal straight with their customers and users, provide them with quality and an agreement of trust.  Google, Facebook, Woot, eBay, all of them had the same opportunity to scam their users&#8230; and they decided not to.But not Yelp.  They decided they couldn&#8217;t handle that, they had to keep scamming and extorting users for some quick profits.   It&#8217;s 2010 on the internet, folks.  You can&#8217;t keep the scam a secret forever.  Someone with some ethics is going to come along and eat you for lunch.  Everyone knows it.In the meantime?  We know the top recommended results on Yelp are paying the extortion fees for placement.  Check them out, and REFUSE to do business with them, under any circumstances.  Once the word gets around Yelp is extorting their customers, top placement on their site will be the kiss of death.  Make it happen.|RF|2010-03-04|1

108|659|how can this ever be extortion?in the worst case scenario yelp said, you have broken the rules so we should remove those recomendations.however if you advertise with us, we will overlook the issue.it might not be the most righteous action, but extortion?|will|2010-03-04|1
109|659|Agreed.  It&#8217;s Yelp&#8217;s site.  I think extortion requires unlawful coercion.   Yelp&#8217;s sales folks might have deployed some sleazy coercion, but unclear how its unlawful.   However, still doesn&#8217;t smell right, but that&#8217;s coming from a user&#8217;s perspective.  Makes their reviews a little less compelling.|jb|2010-03-04|1

114|659|There will surely be email trails and system history logs.  The truth will come out.  Threatening a local merchant&#8217;s business unless you &#8220;pay up&#8221; is extortion.  In my opinion, this is worse than having thugs smash the store front window unless you pay cash in hand to the local gang.|James|2010-03-04|1
115|659|You cannot operate a media property that allows bashing of local businesses, then go and try to sell that same business advertising.  Yelp obviously has no comprehension of this.  If they had hired a few decent sales reps from Alt Weekly newspapers, they would have realized this rule immediately.Yelp can&#8217;t win.  If a business has 90% positive reviews, it looks fishy.  If they have 90% negative reviews, it also looks fishy.|Clark|2010-03-04|1
116|659|As a class action attorney that has one pending case in San Diego county, I highly doubt that this is a &#8220;copy cat&#8221; case.  These cases can sometimes take months to prepare.  The fact that this happened within a week of the first filing probably indicates that this one was cooking for a while and the other attorney beat them to the punch.  If I were to make a suggestion to the plaintiff attorneys, they need to aggressively litigate this case in public.  They should leverage social media tools to get the class involved in the fact-collecting process.  It&#8217;s worked well for my case. http://www.classvefusjon.com.|Kevin Thompson|2010-03-04|1
117|659|Yelp is nothing more than a cleverer version of Ripoffreport.com.  Yelp monetizes businesses using dirty tactics.  If Yelp was sincere in their efforts of being a legitimate review site they would allow businesses to encourage their customers to post reviews.  That would only help Yelp grow their business model (as far as number of users and usefulness), BUT it would limit their ability to blackmail business owners out of money.  I&#8217;ll stop short of calling it a scam, but it&#8217;s a business model that certainly lacks integrity and is not sincere in its efforts.  My prediction is that they&#8217;ll change or eventually fail.|DLK|2010-03-04|1

120|659|I don&#8217;t think any laws were broken here.  I can&#8217;t understand how this is equal to extortion.   Under RICO laws I think it will be hard to prove that yelp is some sort of criminal organization.|cease|2010-03-04|1
121|659|The real question here is what sort of divide is there inside Yelp between sales and editorial?If sales people do not have any ability to influence reviews, then the conversation is over.  If the structure of Yelp is such that a rogue salesperson could easily have reviews taken down, then there&#8217;s a real problem &#8212; because whether upper management intends it or not, rogue sales people WILL try this sort of thing.  The problem of salespeople doing and saying whatever they can, contrary to official policy, to make a sale exists at every company.  You just have to put protections and oversight in place to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen. Did Yelp structure the company so that sales people could not do what&#8217;s being alleged?|Conspiracy Theorist|2010-03-04|1
122|659|I like Yelp and use it often, so nothing against them, but their CEO comes across as a complete dick in his blog posts.

124|659|This is unfortunate, you might say sickening if true. I have a really hard time believing that the CEO could be dumb enough to pull an extortion stunt like this though. &#8220;You won&#8217;t advertise, ok, we&#8217;ll your reviews..&#8221;  First of all, that sounds like a desperation move, and I can&#8217;t believe this company is desperate.

127|659|When a business owner on Yelp gets several negative reviews I always recommend that they really read all of them to see if they can find a common thread and use that information to make upgrades to their service.  In this case, Yelp has an opportunity to look to their practices (many of which have been significantly improved) and address the continuous stream of criticism coming from their only source of revenue &#8211; small business.This recent lawsuit is not the last, but the first of a long string in the works.Tonight I met with Luther, the Yelp Biz mouthpiece, and he&#8217;s doing a great job, but not at all educated about the negative experiences many small business have and how it would be easy to fix, if only Yelp would admit that they might need fixing.  But current management is of the &#8220;I stand by my decision, and that&#8217;s final&#8221; kind of guy that could never consider making an apology to a user, even with copious amounts of documentation that prove the user was unfairly treated.  I&#8217;d recommend that Yelp make that their first order of business.  So take a lesson from Bill Clinton, who after the midterm elections told the new Republican congress, &#8220;I hear you America&#8221;.  It&#8217;s time Yelp actually started listening to the small businesses that make Yelp the thriving community that it is.  When they do that, I&#8217;d lay odds their valuation doubles.|Adryenn Ashley|2010-03-04|1

130|659|I don&#8217;t see from a legal standpoint how this qualifies as extortion but I think there is an ethical question, if, most importantly if,  the case facts are actual FACTS&#8230;I love Yelp and I use it quite rigorously. But I see a trend&#8230; Multiple businesses coming forward with the same allegations &#8211; the question is, what&#8217;s for them to gain to create a false allegation? After all they are all small fishes going against a big giant called YELP..I think this case might redefine the world of online reviews. I will be curious to see what happens next&#8230;|Raj Sarkar|2010-03-04|1
131|659|One word Raj- &#8220;Attorneys&#8217; &#8211; they get a piece of the deal to settle and is cheaper for biz to do so.  I would have to assume there was a prior letter sent to Yelp by Representative attorneys.  I have nothing to back it up but CA is rife with this sort of thing from attorneys.  We had couple disabled attorneys in CA going into decades old establishments and finding no wheel chair ramp to entrance.,  They would file $10k and if you paid would go away and come back next year- good for society?  No, good for selfish reasons.|Dave Hanna|2010-03-05|1
132|659|In the process of developing a new product I&#8217;ve interviewed 10s of businesses about Yelp.  They all have the same story:  As soon as a bad review appears on their profile, a sales person comes calling and offers to &#8220;push down&#8221; the bad reviews in exchange for advertising on the site.The bad reviews are often the sample review on Yelp search results.  Is this extortion?  You be the judge.  I know where I stand on this.|EW|2010-03-05|1

As ochocinco would say &#8220;Child Pleaze&#8221;  Only thing that makes sense is using these reviews as extortion.  How else would they get smb&#8217;s to pay them?

140|659|Yelp sales people have contacted me numerous times even though we keep telling them to STOP calling us.They should also be sued for continued sales calls even after repeated requests that they remove our phone number from their list.|Mikky|2010-03-05|1
141|659|This shows that with all their VC money they cannot successfully execute their business model. MyDocHub.com does doctor and dentist reviews, and does not pressure doctors with sales people. Most doctors contact us directly and we make sure that all their reviews stay as is.|MyDocHub.com Doctor Reviews|2010-03-05|1
142|659|I think there&#8217;s a difference here. Both Stoppelman and TechCrunch linked to posts that tell people not to offer discounts and incentives for review, and not to ask family and friends both of which I totally agree with.But, based on every single thing I&#8217;m reading here, it looks like she simply asked her customers to start reviewing her day spa. To me that&#8217;s a huge difference. If you&#8217;re a business that isn&#8217;t asking for reviews or feedback you&#8217;re probably not doing a good job of listening to your customers. I think you should ALWAYS be asking. It&#8217;s how you find out what&#8217;s working, find our what&#8217;s not, fix problems and get better.|Ron|2010-03-05|1
143|659|Sounds like the day spa needs to fire their publicist.  That said, Yelp&#8217;s CEO should choose his anti-attorney words wisely.  He&#8217;ll need his own legal eagles to defend or dismiss the suit.  Like it or not, lawyers are people, too.|Dino Baskovic|2010-03-05|1
144|659|Even if a store asks or a review, it would still be extortion on Yelp&#8217;s part to ask for money in order to not remove it.Requiring a store to advertise with Yelp in exchange for any form or adding/removing/editing of reviews amounts to extortion, plain and simple.|Mikky|2010-03-05|1

Digg is a social bookmarking service, NOT a URL shortener.  They have no business providing a mirror service to Bit.ly.

198|5766|To be fair, it&#8217;s not like there aren&#8217;t other url shortening services around. I think Digg have done what&#8217;s good for Digg users &#8211; who do use the site for the intended purpose.I do think they&#8217;ll lose a lot of non-digg users who might otherwise have used the bar&#8230; which might turn out to be a short-sighted move as their user-base starts to thin.However, in conclusion, surely they are doing what&#8217;s best for Digg users, and that is their purpose.Justin.|Justin Bellinger|2009-07-19|1
199|5766|This isn&#8217;t surprising at all and frankly I have no problem with it. I would have rather had it do this from the beginning but from my perspective the digg URL shortening service isn&#8217;t a competitor to bit.ly or tinyurl it is basically just for digg users to exchange links. And as long as they aren&#8217;t framing my content I have no problem with it.|mickerlodeon|2009-07-19|1

205|5766|I&#8217;m not clear on the reasons for this but Digg related articles seem to elicit many more replies that reference &#8220;balls&#8221;.My only real comment is that Digg&#8217;s community filtering technology is far more interesting than a redirection flubb &#8212; be it planned or not.  The redirection flubb is a distraction from the talents of the team that built their commenting engine.Drawing a browser to that commenting engine is a flawed decision.  Rather, highlighting or licensing this commenting system would be better.If DISQUS can pull it off, you know Digg could.|Jay Cuthrell|2009-07-19|1

207|5766|i have to say that&#8217;s not a bad move for digg fans, and ONLY for them. I think digg should try to integrate with twitter in a different dimension.If you &#8216;re looking for some fresh ideas on link sharing, try  visiting http://10things.me/|10things.me|2009-07-19|1

222|5766|I can&#8217;t stand the DiggBar. It causes the page load to be drastically slower in my browser (even causing the browser to freeze up a couple of times). Another thing that I don&#8217;t like is that in Digg&#8217;s RSS feeds, the urls go to the Digg page and comments (even if logged into the system already) and it takes yet another click to get to the psuedo-real destination in the DiggBar frame. I&#8217;ve dramatically lessened my activity on Digg as a result of this added feature.|Chris Brown|2009-07-20|1

224|5766|Very shortsighted move. The benefit of the digg bar was that it served as a handy URL shortener that allowed you to bookmark and share the page at teh same time. But most important of all it redirected without people having to click through digg. For digg to take part of that functionality away for users that are not logged in or do not have a digg account is a major problem and for me a reason to stop using the service.|Christian Prada|2009-07-20|1
225|5766|Right now, I&#8217;m seeing the diggbar functioning the same as when it first launched &#8211; always framing itself, whether one is logged in to digg or not.IMHO, the best model was when a logged in digg user got the frame, but otherwise the standard (moved permanently) redirect occurred.|Tollie Williams|2009-07-21|1

230|5767|It&#8217;s not really a blue ocean strategy, but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less smart. These are Red Ocean games in the world of gaming.  Playfish has a version of Brain Age, Worms, etc etc. focusing on how to &#8220;Facebook-it&#8221; instead of the having to worry about the core of the mechanics. None of the games are wholly original and blue ocean, but they are to FB which makes it an excellent tactical and strategic win for Playfish.It&#8217;s just that instead of adapting games from other Facebook games, they are looking to the world of Nintendo for their inspiration.

248|5767|playfish is waay waaaay ahead of zynga in terms of anything relating to quality. zynga is all about making a quick buck by sending out span and abusing users. playfish is a proper game company. in fact, their games could very well stand on their own outside of social networks (they are not very social).|10things.me|2009-07-19|1

Zynga definitely have the best Mafia game on FB and the iPhone but it looks like this delay by Apple could cost them since many players are abndoning ship.

256|5767|Nice to see you looking beyond Zynga and the USA for the online games market. I&#8217;ve met Kristian twice and seem him pitch once. He is clear and concise and certainly knows where he is going plus his company is particularly well funded for a European starttup. Playfish is going places in its space that much is certain, I did not know they were already profitable so congrats. Also I think that this is one industry where European companies better understanding of cultural differences,  the fact we need to focus on quality and profits might give us an advantage. Actually the leaders in the space are in Europe and Asia not the USA..  There are some really strong players in Europe already other than playfish,  companies like:  GameForge, Dofus, eRepublik (my company), Moshi Monsters etc&#8230; that are doing extremely well. Its a very exciting and fun space to be in.|Alexis Bonte|2009-07-20|1
