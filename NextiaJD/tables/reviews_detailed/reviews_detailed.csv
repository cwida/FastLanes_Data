6369|29428|2010-03-14|84790|Nancy|Simon and Arturo have the ultimate location in Madrid!  Steps from the Metro and bus line to everywhere you want to visit.  The accomodations are clean, well appointed and fantastic views of Madrid skyline.  We felt like it was a spa when walking into the flat.  We were greeted warmly and offered lots of information to get up and running for our short stay.  We wished we could have stayed longer and we highly recommend this location and neighborhood.
6369|31018|2010-03-23|84338|David|Myself and Kristy originally planned on staying with Arturo for only a week, but when our plans changed, Arturo was very open to working with our changing schedule. Arturo and Simon were very friendly and helpful throughout our ten day visit. Our room was very clean and well kept. The view is amazing and the location is perfect. We're going to be traveling around Europe for another four months, and were joking that Arturo set the standards so high that we highly doubt we're going to be able to do any better, and it's true! Thank you so much Arturo and Simon, you were both very gracious, helpful and respectful of our space. I would highly recommend you and your flat to anyone traveling who wants a quite place with a great views, wonderful/clean rooms, a respectful and honest atmosphere. Thank you so much for being such an outstanding host! 
6369|34694|2010-04-10|98655|Marion|We had a great time at Arturo and Simon's ! A cosy apartment and a wonderful terrasse, and above all, really nice hosts ! Thank you...
6369|37146|2010-04-21|109871|Kurt|"I very much enjoyed the stay.  
It's a wonderful room and bath in a great apartment with a lovely terrace. The location is perfect for me, especially given the easy access to the the Metro and the airport.  I look forward to returning!

6369|41548|2010-05-10|95579|Deborah|Perfect airbnb experience as all others say. Lots of reasonable cafes or places to buy prepared food to eat at home in area. Room with terrace and ensuite prefect. Easy to get to from airport and to go all around Madrid on the metro. Arturo and Simon are the perfect hosts, helpful and hospitable (loved Simons mint tea and thanks for use of computer and internet) but also you feel you have lots of privacy. 
6369|42550|2010-05-15|106586|Nina|Great host, great apartment! I had the bath to myself which was great. Neighborhood is safe and clean. Convenient store, bank, coffee shop and tapas bar nearby. It's so close you can crawl to it. Overall a great experience:) Also glad there is an elevator. 
6369|45278|2010-05-23|112662|Bo|We had a wonderful time in Madrid and the stay at Arturo´s place is recommendable! Especially the terrace is a hit.
6369|45618|2010-05-24|18688|Charde|"We only stayed here for one night unfortunately, but it was superb value for money. Clean, sunny and spacious with welcoming hosts. It is not in the city centre, but Madrid is easily navigated with the metro, so that isn't really an issue!

Would definitely recommend!"
6369|57074|2010-06-25|134713|Y. S.|Great room in non-touristy location.  Convenient to the metro and has lots of tapas bars, bakeries, etc. nearby.
6369|58370|2010-06-28|103204|Derek|"Arturo and Simon were extremely welcoming to my girlfriend and I during our trip to Madrid. The proximity of his apartment to the airport, and the air conditioning are big pluses in our book. Also, having traveled elsewhere around Spain, having an elevator is also a big plus. The rate was extremely affordable, and Arturo definitely deserves the five star rating on this site. 

Two things to keep in mind when booking. First, while the Madrid metro is extremely convenient, Arturo's apartment isn't close to downtown Madrid. This may not matter to you, but as young-ish first time travelers to Madrid, we had some late nights coming back to the apartment. Despite that, I thought that being close to the airport was a nice compromise.

Also, there isn't a lock on the door. This wasn't a huge deal for my girlfriend and me (hence the 5 star rating), but if that's going to bother you, keep it in mind. "
6369|93562|2010-09-09|142487|Rachel|Arturo and Simon were the most welcoming and accomadating hosts ever.  The apartment was beautiful and well maintained, the access from the metro was handy and just on the doorstep. The roof top terrace was amazing and the bedroom was spacious and comfortable. When we visit Madrid again we will definitely stay there. 
6369|95547|2010-09-12|105946|Hanzel|Hello, great location and amazing space!! The metro is easy to get to the flat, thank you Arturo for having me stay in your flat. All the best Hanzel Moreno
6369|97782|2010-09-15|212797|Carlos|There is no better place to stay if you are visiting Madrid. The metro station is 30 yards from the entrance of the building. If you prefer to take the bus, the bus stop is across the street. Either way it takes 15 minutes to downtown Madrid. The neighborhood is great, with bars and restaurants close by, but also quiet at night. We stayed  at the bigger room that has a private bathroom. It was as good as staying in a high scale hotel, with the convenience of having more space. The apartment is terrific. The terrace is wonderful. Finally and most importantly, Arturo is a great host, willing to answer any question and willing to give you tips to make your stay in Madrid outstanding. Thanks you so much!
6369|105993|2010-09-27|51776|Leigh|It couldn't have been better. The room and terasse were lovely, clean, with a comfortable bed, and were convenient to everything. Arturo and Simon are completely marvelous as well. I enjoy both of them very much and only regret living so far away that I will not be able to visit them frequently. I will certainly recommend this room to anyone visiting Madrid.
6369|115173|2010-10-10|159607|Holly & Tyler|"We stayed with Arturo and Simon and had a very pleasant stay. While we did not meet Arturo (we kept missing like ships in the night) we were welcomed and entertained by Simon. This is a great place to stay if you are looking to stay in a more ""real"" neighbourhood that is light on tourists and heavy on locals. There is a great market nearby for coffee, tortilla espagnola, and lots of fresh veggies and the like. The room was great - airy, comfortable, and pleasantly connected to a bathroom. "
6369|118924|2010-10-14|184176|Evi&Hugo|My boyfriend Hugo and I had a wonderful stay with Arturo! Right away, he welcomed us with hot coffee and a quick chat. He was kind and helpful throughout our stay, and the room was large and clean, with a great newly remodeled bathroom. Perhaps the best part is the location! It's a direct shot to the airport on the pink metro line, just a few stops, and then again very easy to get to the center for all the tourist sites. There's also a great large indoor food market just across the street, and a shop where you can buy hot food to go (El Sabroso). We bought a large roasted chicken, croquettes, an entire Spanish tortilla, and green peas for just 12 euros, and had an amazing feast on the terrace right outside our room. Highly recommended!
6369|131856|2010-11-02|185723|Pascale|"Nice place to stay. 
It's close to the subway to go to the center, direct line to the airport (15-20min).
The room is nice with a big bathroom ... the weather was not that good to enjoy the terrasse but it should be wonderfull to take the breakfast if the weather is sunny.
We strongly recommend :-)"
6369|138625|2010-11-14|271439|Jordan|Best place to stay in Madrid. Love tbe rooftop views. Very friendly hosts. Right next to the subway stop which makes it very convenient. Great neighborhood with great eats. 
6369|145579|2010-11-28|257278|Laura|"Arturo and Simon were excellent hosts.  It was my first time staying at an airbnb location and I'll be sure to use it in the future because of what a great experience it was.  Mi novio y yo had a wonderful vacation.
The most important thing was that Arturo and Simon were friendly and hospitable.  It was like I was a regular renter and could use the apartment as I liked.  At first I felt a bit uneasy about this since it wasn't my home, but by the last couple of days I finally felt like I lived there.  Next time I will feel more at home from the beginning.  
Also, the place was quiet and allowed for a good sleep after a day of meandering around Madrid.  
There were places to eat nearby but we usually went out to places recommended to us by (Hidden by Airbnb) or a tour book.  Do not forget to ask Arturo or Simon about the market nearby.  
There is a public phone and an ATM in front of the building as well as the metro access available right across the street.  It was very convenient.  "
6369|150241|2010-12-07|199871|Carolina|"We got to Madrid on a holiday and we could not have the chance to meet Arturo and his couple. We  found a very nice appartment the room was big and the bed comfy :) We got there on winter so we did not use the terrace that in summer time I bet is great!  
Arturo was very nice when I contacted him to reserve the room and actually he was giving me some advices about where to eat in Madrid. We definitely want to go back if we go to Madrid again soon.. "
6369|172479|2011-01-19|326460|E. Alex|Arturo was an absolute sweetheart! We arrived half an hour later than expected and he was still around to greet us. The room was clean, the bed extremely comfortable for two and the bathroom was by far the largest we had ever stayed (in Europe).  Despite the cold, the rooftop terrace was gorgeous and very comfortable. Arturo was kind enough to let us use the washer and was always very helpful. The apt itself is about a 25-30 minute bus trek, but in a very scenic and comfortable route. Would absolutely love to stay again! 
6369|189700|2011-02-28|353655|Bob|"What can I say that hasn't been already said about Arturo's place.  He is a warm, welcoming and considerate host.  For anyone who is new to Madrid, he is helpful about answering any questions and providing local knowledge to make your visit more enjoyable.  The neighborhood is great and has many local shops and markets.  If you are looking for a place to work out, ask Arturo for directions to the local public fitness facility - 4.50 euros for a clean, well equipped  gym about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. Staying here made us feel like we were living more like a local and away from the tourist/business crowds you find at the more typical hotel facilities. The room is perfect - big, bright and airy with a huge remodeled bathroom.  We had several lovely night sitting on the terrace drinking wine and taking in the Madrid night sky.  The subway is literally outside your door which connects easily you to any part of the city - including the Bajaras airport (super convenient). If you don't book here you are missing out on the best deal in Madrid!
Muchas gracias, Arturo."
6369|196698|2011-03-11|405032|Ian|Arturo is great, very welcoming.  Location is good, handy metro, and easy to get to airport and downtown.  Enjoyed the stay.
6369|201959|2011-03-18|389788|Elna|The host canceled my reservation 53 days before arrival.
6369|201960|2011-03-18|214835|Christy|The host canceled my reservation 56 days before arrival.
6369|211858|2011-03-29|325772|Justin|Arturo and Simon were extemely helpful during our stay in Madrid. They have a beautifully appointed apartment, well stocked and very clean. The terrace is gorgeous, my wife and I had several meals outside. It was also in a very convenient area. It is, as Arturo and Simon say, quite literally 10 steps to their door from the metro. Thanks Again! 
6369|232786|2011-04-20|379974|Geoffrey|We enjoyed our stay in Arturo's Rooftop Terrasse room.  Arturo and Simon made us very welcome.  The facilities were very clean, neat and well-maintained.  The bathroom especially was modern and roomy.  It was delightful to be able to have our meals on the terrace.  We appreciated being able to have access to the apartment's laundry.  The location was very satisfactory, with access to the city centre by the Metro station just over the road from the accommodation.  The neighbourhood was both quiet and interesting.
6369|240416|2011-04-26|393135|Chi Chi|"Our stay with aurturo and simon was wonderful! The room was more than we expected and would rival any room in a top end hotel. The terrace was a lovely addition, it was nice waking up to sunshine. The apartment is super close to the columbia metro stn which takes you dt in less than half hour. It is also conveniently close to the airport as well.
Both hosts were fabulous and they made our stay comfortable and enjoyable :) thank you!"
6369|253678|2011-05-06|186485|Angela|Excellent place in Madrid! Arturo and Simon were great hosts. The room has a very comfortable bed (best sleep we've had in weeks), a huge bathroom and a beautiful terrace. Subway station right at the door (in nice area) with direct access to the airport. Would definitely stay with Arturo if we're back in Madrid!
6369|266915|2011-05-16|529463|Marc|It was a pleasure to stay at Arturo's place. The room and bathroom are clean and spacious and the terrace is perfect for having breakfast in the morning. The location of the apartment is a bit far from the center by foot but the metro station is really close. There are however a bunch of clubs 5 min away if you want to go out in the neighborhood.
6369|278110|2011-05-24|341324|Tim|The apartment was great with access to the Metro just outside the front door of the building.  Arturo provided literature about Madrid to assist in locating and planning various venues.  The room with private bath was first class and the bathroom was large with a very large shower.  The use of the kitchen allowed meals to be prepared thereby reducing the overall cost of the stay.  The terrace was a plus for the apartment.  The room was clean, neat and tastefully decorated.  I would stay with Arturo again when in Madrid.
6369|284115|2011-05-27|145586|Kaiser|My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Arturo's top floor apartment. He is very kind and accomodating. The room and bathroom are very comfortable, clean and large. The best part is the access to patio, we enjoyed evenings there. He gave us information on the city as well. He helped me park my car as well. there is a Metro station in the same block.  I will stay again in a heartbeat. 
6369|301653|2011-06-07|359010|Beate|"We had a great time at Arturo's place. The roof terrace was overwhelming, Arturo was very nice with all his tipps and recommendations. Our room was very nicely decorated and clean. If we come back we'd definitely stay again at his place. Again, it was brilliant, thanks Arturo..
Beate and Traute"
6369|311551|2011-06-13|251582|Joel|Great place, wonderful host.  Bedroom has its own (big) bathroom and access to the terrace (as photos show).  Metro is literally outside the building.  It's a bit of a ride to downtown (two connections to get to Puerta del Sol) but it's easy enough -- I don't think you can find a place of equal quality and value close to the center.  If you're a nightowl and tend to stay out late (Metro closes at 1:30am), I am told there's a nightbus from downtown (or you can always take the taxi -- around 14 euro).  I would definitely recommend it to friends visiting Madrid.
6369|325909|2011-06-21|360220|Sebastien|Very good experience. My wife and I stayed at Arturo's for 7 nights and we will repeat that experience anytime. The location is great although a little far from the city center (but close to the airport and Madrid's subway is great). The room is large with a nice bathroom, the terrace is amazing and Arturo's friend who were also staying there during  our stay (Rafa and Anniel) were very friendly. That helped us to really appreciate Madrid. Muy buena calidad a buen precio. 
6369|333346|2011-06-25|382675|Ronni|Arturo was not there, but his friends took over, and they were very nice and hospitable to me. It's a great room, fantastic bathroom, really nice rooftop terrasse, and the Colombia Metro is litteraly at the doorstep. I wish I had had to stay longer :-) 
6369|339699|2011-06-28|492709|Jenn|Arturo was on vacation but his roommate Rafa was an great host and an excellent guy. We really enjoyed hanging out with him.  The room was beautiful - hardwood floors, air conditioning, firm bed, garden terrace, private two sink bathroom.  Location was next to the Columbia train line which during the weekend takes about 20 min to get to Plaza del sol.  Would definitely stay there again.
6369|353275|2011-07-05|448298|Norman|My visit to Madrid was spectacular, and the stay at Arturo place was extremely comfortable......when booking it would be very fesible to select the room with the restroom attached...that was convient.  It was truly the couples retreat. We had Peace of Mind the neighborhood was extremely assesble to metro, autobus and taxi's....This place I highly recommend. I am booking for next year.
6369|360810|2011-07-08|726600|Germano|Impeccable Hospitality and very comfortable place. I warmly reccomend it to anyone going to Madrid. Thank you Arturo
6369|366784|2011-07-11|349137|Yumi|This was our first time to Madrid and it was great. Lovely apartment and nice area. After walking around the city all day, it was great to return to Arturo's peaceful apartment with the relaxing terrace. Thanks!
6369|373264|2011-07-14|629319|Caroline|Arturo is warm, his place is kitted out nicely and the balcony is an oasis in busy Madrid. Don't over think it, just book. 
6369|385877|2011-07-20|793315|Tui|My partner and I spent 4 nights at Arturo´s place and it was our first Airbnb experience and it was definately a great one. The location of the apartment is great and makes getting around Madrid so easy with the metro stop literally at your doorstep. The room with the ensuite was beautiful and the roof top terrace was great. It was really clean and tidy and had everything you needed, ie kitchen etc. Arturo and his friends were also super helpful. definately stay again.
6369|423784|2011-08-06|815523|Gail|Excellent bedroom and bath, huge compared to others.  Lots of restaurants and food to be found in the neighborhood.  The Metro stops right at the front door so the schleping of luggage is not so bad.  Most highly recommend staying with Simon and Arturo!
6369|438257|2011-08-12|500492|Sophia|"Charming hosts, beautifully appointed room in a good location. 
Would highly recommend."
6369|451828|2011-08-16|923503|Mark|Arturo was a very hospitable host.  Very accommodating and available to contact when I had questions.  Would highly recommend.
6369|475715|2011-08-26|953107|Piyush|The host canceled my reservation 19 days before arrival.
6369|478233|2011-08-27|586725|Josh + Laura|We were really happy the location is great! Only a few minutes to the subway and fairly close to the airport. Easily accessible. The bathroom was huge, the bedroom was really nice and comfortable and we were able to do your washing which was great. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet and has some really great restaurants. All up we had a great time, Arturo was an excellent host he spoke clear english and booked us a taxi to the airport. Would definitely stay here again.  
6369|579796|2011-09-29|556748|Jean|"The place was simply perfect. 

Arturo was away, but his friend Rafa was a very generous and friendly  host. My stay  was everything one could wish for; a well appointed, air conditionned and above all quiet  room with a full bathroom and, of course, the terrace which was such a plus. 

I was tempted to write an awful review just to keep this wonderful place a secret for myself, my  friends and relatives ;-) but that would have been unfair. 

So, yes, I highly recommend the Rooftop terrace room of Arturo.
"
6369|605342|2011-10-07|184042|John And Nathan|Thank you so much for this wonderful place to stay.  Arturo and Simon were away so we didn't get to meet them, but Rafa and Aniel were perfect hosts.  The apartment is convenient for everything and is in a very nice neighborhood with a beautiful market and good restaurants.  The apartment is exactly as described and is quiet and comfortable.  Really excellent and highly recommended.
6369|627473|2011-10-14|874563|Christian|"During our first trip to Madrid, we spent five nights in this beautiful bedroom. The spacious bathroom and the brilliant terrace were a big plus. The apartment is situated in a pleasant neighbourhood. We enjoyed the ""chocolateria Lyon"" just round the corner as a cosy place for having breakfast. Rafa and Aniel were warm-hearted and helpful hosts. We highly recommend this place and hope to return soon again."
6369|641151|2011-10-18|272881|Eric|We stayed in this room two times during our recent trip to Spain for a total of 9-nights.  The apartment is located just steps to the nearest metro station.  This is ideal if you're doing an airport transfer as it is just a few more stops on the same train line to the international airport.  While most tourist sights will be a short train ride away we found this neighborhood to be pleasantly Spanish.  Without hotels there aren't many other tourists around.  Within a one-block radius you'll find a dozen good restaurants, a grocery store, a bakery, and a huge Spanish market with dozens of vendors selling cured meat, raw meat, fish, cheese, produce, and more.  There is a park a short walk away. Arturo was out of town when we visited so his roommate Rafa welcomed us in.  Simply put, Rafa is the best roommate you could ask for.  He is exceedingly friendly and we really liked him.   This room has fast wifi, a big comfortable bed, a door to the very large shared terrace, and a large en-suite bathroom.  There's also a good air conditioning unit in your room.  The bedroom is very quiet, no traffic noise, no neighbors, but you can hear some noise from the elevator when it is moved.  Arturo has left out some maps, guides, and outlet adaptors if you need them. We really enjoyed our time here.  We would recommend this room to anyone and everyone and would stay here again too.  
6369|666569|2011-10-26|1197146|Lorne|Enjoyed my stay.  The rooftop terrace was very pleasant.
6369|803842|2011-12-24|212797|Carlos|This was our second time at Arturo's Place.  The room is excellent. The apartment is in a great location, just steps away from the subway, in a lovely neighborhood, full of bars, restaurants and markets. The hosts are wonderful people. I have a hard time thinking on a better place to stay while visiting Madrid.
6369|64022942|2016-02-28|12787300|Matthew|Host was very welcoming, kind, everything we needed for the stay was in the room.  Lovely comfortable bed with en suite bathroom and a door to a terrace outside with views across Madrid.  Apartment is lovely in a good location, and right by the metro station.  I feel the host went above the normal call of duty to make our stay as comfortable as possible.  I would definitely recommend this room to other users. 
6369|67786575|2016-03-31|26050860|Marion|Arturo est très sympa et nous avons été très bien reçu. La chambre et la salle de bain sont conformes aux photos et très propres.Arturo à été arrangeant pour l'heure d'arrivée et de départ.Nous avons passé un très bon week-end!

6369|71379109|2016-04-25|64420004|Jungyun|it was our first time in madrid. it was rainy day when we arrived and we were very confused. we have no umbrella and were in the very strange city(of course, now i love the city!) but we didn't have to worry. when we went out the metro, there was a arturo's house right beside the metro! arturo very welcomed us. the room was very comfortable and very cozy. balconi was awesome(although we couldn't enjoy balconi because of the rain). arturo was kind and generous host. we were very happy in arturo's house. and neighborhood is cool. there are nice bars and markets. we want to go back to madrid. then i want to stay in arturo' house again. thank you arturo! 
6369|76705035|2016-05-29|7362804|Darren|"Great place to stay. Large space, private ensuite (but full bathroom size) comfortable bed, access to large balcony from bedroom. 

Despite being close to train and buses, room was quiet. 

Arturo is very prompt with communication, and relaxed and casual. Also friendly, fun and accommodating. 

I'd definitely stay here again "

6369|421345481|2019-03-09|54672615|Pernille|"Simon is an excellent host. All communication with him was easy and precise.

The room and bathroom are very nice and light. The direct access to the nice terrace is absolutely a big bonus.

The apartment is a little away from the city center (20 mins on the metro), but with plenty places to eat and drink in the neighborhood. I If you are looking for a nice place away from all tourist crowds, Simon’s place is a good option."
6369|427310285|2019-03-23|154718569|Daorsa|"I loved staying at Simon and Arturo’s place! The apartment is so cute and the terrace is perfect for morning coffee. Both Arturo and Simon were super welcoming and they made my stay in Madrid that much better. 
The location of the apartment is very convenient too, there’s a bus stop just outside the apartment that will take you to the center (Sol) in no more than 30mins. 
Would definitely stay here again if I’m ever back in Madrid."
6369|445945748|2019-04-30|96974336|Julie|Casual and comfortable are two words that describe a stay with Simon. He's a warm and friendly host and shares the apartment with great respect to his guests.  The location is superb. Easy walk to stores, restaurants, and the Metro, with a direct line to the airport. We look forward to a return visit.
6369|452929783|2019-05-14|146699277|Christopher|I had an excellent stay at Simon & Arturo’s place. They were incredibly nice and very helpful. The apartment is in a relaxed neighborhood, 15-30 minutes north of all the hectic touristy parts (20 paces to Columbia subway), still with easy access to it all (€13 taxi or uber off peak - but be careful of uber price gouging for busy hours - €48 at 9pm on a Friday night to the outskirts of the city center (taxi was still only €14). There was a nearby gym that offered 1 week memberships, with a pool (open swim 3x a day), boxing heavy-bag, free weights & machines, cardio machines & spin. The private bathroom attached to bedroom was really nice to have, as was the private bedroom entranceway to the huge garden balcony. I highly recommend Simon’s apartment! I would stay here again if in Madrid.

21853|21051116|2014-10-10|8506071|Pedro Abel|Mi experiencia en casa de Adel fue buena, aunque al principio costo un poco ponernos de acuerdo para hacer la entrada al final conseguimos encontrar una hora conveniente para los dos. Aunque la casa y en especial la cocina estaba algo desordenada la habitación si estaba limpia y ordenada. El sitio es un barrio tranquilo y bien comunicado.
21853|21268157|2014-10-13|19062863|Olga| Adel is a very warm person and thoughtful! He didn't have a hairdryer, but he bought one the next morning! Pretty cool, right? :) and the room has a nice view of the city, plus it's close to a park from where you can get great shots!
21853|22527396|2014-11-09|6099461|Hugh|Adel is an exceptionally welcoming host. I was ill during my stay and he was kind enough to accompany me to the doctor to translate for me! He really is an exceptionally pleasant person, very laid back and an interesting, knowledgable and articulate talker, even though he claims his English isn't that good! I couldn't recommend staying with him more highly.
21853|22684525|2014-11-11|23357657|Sendy|"Adel fue muy amable, incluso el día de mi llegada fue por mi a la salida del metro y me ayudó con mi equipaje :). Durante mi estancia fue muy respetuoso y agradable, me explicó cómo funcionaban las cosas, me dió algunos tips para ahorrar. Es muy buen conversador y un a persona flexible en cuanto al check in y check out.

La habitación es suficiente para una persona, estaba limpio y como soy muy friolenta Adel me ofreció cobijas extra. No tuve problemas con el internet. 

Gracias Adel.

21853|22871843|2014-11-16|4072731|Nati|Abdel ha sido un magnífico anfitrión y la mejor forma que se me ocurre para describirlo es que me he sentido como en mi propia casa. Además, la casa es bonita, está limpia y es muy cómoda. Todo muy recomendable con ellos.
21853|23955937|2014-12-15|23750476|Lena|"Adel( il n'y a plus de José) m'a très bien reçu. Toujours près à faire la conversation en français ou en espagnol(anglais si vous le voulez), mais pas envahissant. Très serviable et surtout souriant.
L'appartement et bien équipé, bien agencé et bien situé(20 minutes du centre en métro)même si le quartier, lui-même, n'a rien d'extraordinaire.

La chambre et le lit sont suffisamment grands pour une personne et les murs sont fraîchement peints :)
L'ambiance et la propreté des lieux dépendent des personnes qui y vivent. C'est plus une collocation qu'un Bed and Breakfast(séjour d'un mois pour moi). Jouez le jeu!( discutez autour d'un thé, cuisinez et dinez avec les autres lorsque c'est possible, nettoyez après vous..)

Je me suis assez rapidement sentis comme chez moi et j'y retournerai volontiers lors de mon prochain voyage à madrid.

21853|26150954|2015-02-05|22583630|Suzi|"Adel is a very warm person. Actually, it was first time to come to Madrid and I couldn't speak Spanish at all also, that's why I felt little uneasy.
However, Adel helped me everything; I asked Adel to talk with taxi driver and he did for me so, I could get home safely. 
I was lucky that I could meet a person who speaks English in Madrid(it is quite hard to find).
In addition, this house makes me feel like it is my real home that I am living in my country and he and flatmate are like my real family.
I love this house and people and even, Airbnb as well.
I am sure I am going to stay this house if I come to Madrid again.
Gracias:D"
21853|31678708|2015-05-08|32483419|Eunzi|Adel and Nati(another flatmate) are very warm and kind. Even though it is not exactly in center, I was happy as I felt like it is real home and they are real family also, I love its neighborhood as well. People are all nice and welcoming in Calle de Carols Fuentes. The area is quite easy and close to get to the center so, I was also satisfied with its location.

Living in this apartment definitely made my experience in Spain - amazing!! If I could I would stay longer.
I loved the environment in this apartment, and living in this neighborhood it felt as if I was a permanent resident in Madrid - I felt part of the local community."

The flat is clean and tidy. The location of the flat is close to two metro stations and well connected with buses, to take you into the centre within 15-20 minutes. I am very thankful to have met Adel and Nati, and I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in Madrid.

My only issue, and that's not Abdel's fault, is that walls seem to be very thin and doors a bit creaky... :) I was in the room next to the bathroom (there is another room for rent), as well as next to the other apartment's bathroom... and so whenever anyone took a shower or was using bathroom, I would wake up :(  Something to consider if you're a light sleeper..."

When the owner came by the last days she mentioned to us,that she was missing some books from the bookshelves(we were very surprised by the remark).
Other than the above it was a pleasant stay, the Air conditioner was probably the best since Madrid was extremely hot during the week that we visited"

The apartment is spotless and with a bedroom at each end of the living area offers a good separation of space.  The air conditioner and shower were both great which was a significant consideration for us in June, when it was hot.  Finally, the location in convenient, and within walking distance of just about everything.  The only negative comment might be that sometimes the street is a little noisy at night.  In all, Tenty's apartment provided a very nice home away from home for us, and they did everything to make sure this was the case.

There are 2 bedrooms ( on the different sides of the apartment) , spacious bathroom, plenty of storage place, and small but well equipped kitchen. 
Goyo and Tenty are absolutely adorable and very helpful hosts!  I've never met anyone like them! They provided us with all necessary information about Madrid, helped to carry our luggage ( it was so great , especially because i was travelling with my grandparents), helped to rent a car and even went to Avis with me to pick it up! I highly recommend this apartment and i'm sure that my next time in Madrid i'll try to stay in ""cosy "" apartment again."

The only drawback was that there was no Wifi, but there are plenty of cafes nearby.

The apartment was exactly as described and shown in the photos.  It was super clean and it's location was very convenient for getting on and off the metro and to places of interest in Madrid.  My husband and I stayed for 11 nights and we were so pleased with the layout of the apartment and all it had to offer.  It was so convenient to have a small grocery store so close by.  This was our first trip to Europe and our first airbnb experience which was delightful!  We appreciated the great communication with our hosts before and during our stay.  Goyo met us a few blocks away from the apartment to guide us to the door.  He alerted us to the convenience of the airport shuttle bus within a short walk to the apartment for 5 Euros per person.  And he texted us during our stay just to check in and make sure everything was ok in the apartment and to make some helpful sightseeing suggestions.  We appreciated their great hospitality!  Thank you for everything!

Tenty & Goyo are wonderful hosts, meeting us at the apartment when it was most convenient for our travel schedule and welcoming us with a delicious bottle of Spanish red wine. They also stayed in contact throughout our visit, offering up help with sightseeing and restaurant selections, even arranging our taxi to airport - better than a hotel concierge! The apartment was perfect for our family of four - size, location, cleanliness - exactly as referenced in the listing. Just steps from a grocery, many restaurants, bars and Gran Via, including Hop On Hop Off stop, local bus and metro lines. The street can be noisy late into the night (especially weekends) but have to think that's same with any apartment, plus hot water was a bit limited but that encouraged us to be out exploring Madrid! Would definitely stay again when in Madrid.

We found the location to be very central and close to great food and transportation options, which was critical for our travel with toddler twins. The hosts were extremely helpful, responsive and accommodating of our need to check in early and our slightly delayed departure due to car trouble. They were also very helpful with tips and recommendations for the area and provided many guide books/maps. Given the location, the elevator and the second bedroom, it was good and safe for our young family.

Very clean, plenty of room for two people, and even with four people we had adequate space. The four balconies are a nice touch, and the flat is nicely appointed. All beds were comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed, and the living room was perfect for afternoon siestas.

To explore Madrid, the location is fantastic - walking distance to Palacio Cibeles, the Prado Museum, Plaza Mayor, Palacio Real, everything is within 25 minutes walk. A metro station and several bus stations are also a few minutes walk away for longer trips. Within 10 minutes walk you'll find dozens of restaurants, Cervezerias, tapas bars, a lovely market, and many bodegas and grocery stores.

Highly recommend!"

Su inmejorable ubicación representa una excelente opción para quienes desean vivir la experiencia madrileña de un barrio céntrico, alegre y jovial cerca de la Gran Vía.  El piso está mucho mejor que lo que las fotos del anuncio presentan y reflejan el cuidado y atención que los anfitriones han puesto en esta inmejorable opción en el Centro de Madrid.
Mención aparte requiere las atenciones, sugerencias y recomendaciones de conocedores que nos dieron Tenty y Goyo.  Muchísimas gracias por todas ellas, hicieron la diferencia sin duda."

El departamento es exactamente como lo describen: espacioso, luminoso y con una ubicación super cómoda. ¡Gracias Tenty y Goyo por tan buena atención!

24836|257186629|2018-04-25|96455219|Rubina|We stayed at Tenty and Goyo’s apartment for five nights and we loved it! They were very helpful with suggestions and communicating with us all the time. They met us when we arrived and helped us with our tons of luggage. The lift in the building helped transport our bags to the unit. The place was very clean and functional. We loved the bathroom which I think had been newly refurbished and there’s a washing machine that helped with the laundry. The apartment was of good size and we had a comfortable stay. The location can’t be beat and this is the highlight of what the apartment is all about. It’s close to nearly everything you can think of. The two best paella restaurants in Rome is just a few minutes walk. Tapas bar,bakery,grocery,pharmacy are just a few steps away. It’s very central and we just walked to everywhere. Thank you Tenty and Goyo for lending us your apartment. It’s a home sweet home.

La ubicación es inmejorable, se llega andando a los lugares de interés en cuestión de minutos. Y en la misma calle hay un supermercado, tiendas y lugares para comer. Tenty y Goyo son extremadamente atentos, y estuvieron disponibles en todo momento para cualquier consulta o necesidad. Fue un placer pasar unos días en Madrid en este piso. Lo recomiendo fuertemente.

24836|276197423|2018-06-13|188064344|Michael|All I can say is wow!  Tenty and Goyo are tremendous hosts!  They are the nicest people and are very responsive.   They helped us navigate Madrid and gave us great tips as well as a nice welcome bottle of wine!  As for their home, location,  location,  location!   Perfect spot for all of the attractions and Plaza Mayor which is a great hang out with tons of restaurants and shopping.   Cheap local market is a few doors down, as is dozens of eateries.   We took a cab once and only because of time. Otherwise we walkwd to everything we wanted to see.  There  is lots of excitement in this neighborhood.   I did use earplugs two nights, but that was friday and Saturday nights where people are out a bit later.  Not bad, just recommended bringing just in case you r a light sleeper.  Check in and out was easy and communication excellent!   Oh yeah, and the place is really nice with necessary amenities and very clean and comfy for the four of us.  Thank you for making our trip to Madrid so memorable!
24836|290788735|2018-07-15|9270126|Michael|"Goyo and Tenty were extremely welcoming and helpful. The location is excellent, the San Anton market nearby is a good option for a variety of tapas.

The only downside was that there was construction on the facade of the building (that Goyo notified us of in advance) so the windows were blocked and there was some noise, but it didn’t matter too much because we were out and about most of the time."
24836|326932597|2018-09-23|36186920|Cristina|El apartamento de Tenty y Goyo es totalmente recomendable. La úbicación es inmejorable, el apartamento está reformado, es muy acogedor y tiene todo lo necesario. Es tal y como se ve en las fotos.

A pasitos de la Gran Via, la cibeles, el parque de Retiro, la puerta de Sol.. pudimos hacer todo el turismo caminando! La recepcion de los anfitriones fue Excelente, como nos retardamos debido al niño pequeño y las maletas (la estacion de Renfe-trenes cercana No tiene ascensor, y se nos complico porque eran muchas escaleras) Goyo nos fue a buscar y nos facilito la llegada al departamento. Sin dudas volveriamos!! Gracias!

24836|448377655|2019-05-05|8579359|Michael|"We enjoyed our stay at the apartment as it allowed us to have an amazing time in Madrid.

We enjoyed the location as it was very central and close to the places we wanted to visit. There is two supermarkets nearby, one of them had a market with a food market in the higher floors. 

The hospitality of Goyo and Tenty was outstanding. They waited for us to checkin at 10:30pm but also allowed us to check out in the afternoon. Also they provided us two pair of keys that was very handy for our group of four people."

24836|467157607|2019-06-10|56227082|Stephanie|Cannot say enough good things about these hosts. They greeted us outside and showed us the apartment as soon as we arrived. They had wine for us and told us everything we needed to know about the apartment. The apartment was perfectly clean with everything we needed stocked and in the most amazing area. The terraces were our favorite part! So amazing to wake up and see beautiful Madrid from 4 different terraces every morning. Tenty was responsive when we needed something and went above and beyond even offering to book us a cab to the airport. Most amazing host we’ve ever experienced!
24836|475390806|2019-06-24|120691102|Amanda|El apartamento está muy bien ubicado, cerca de los principales lugares turísticos y con una oferta gastronómica interesante. El edificio es antiguo pero tiene  todos los servicios de cualquier edificio (ventaja: tiene ascensor).  El apartamento es generoso en los espacios, tiene una decoración muy familiar y con todo lo necesario para tener una muy cómoda estadía. Goyo y Tenty son magníficos anfitriones, siempre estuvieron pendientes de nuestra estadía. Esperamos volver a Madrid y alojarnos en este apartamento.
24836|479565036|2019-07-01|33275838|Alain|Tenty y Goyo son de los mejores anfitriones que nos hemos encontrado nunca. Atentos y “encabezonados” porque la experiencia en la casa y en Madrid sea de 10. La casa además tiene encanto y está mejor localizada imposible. Así da gusto! Repetiremos.
