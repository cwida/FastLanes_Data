The accomodations are clean, well appointed and fantastic views of Madrid skyline.  We felt like it was a spa when walking into the flat.  We were greeted warmly and offered lots of information to get up and running for our short stay.  We wished we could have stayed longer and we highly recommend this location and neighborhood.",
