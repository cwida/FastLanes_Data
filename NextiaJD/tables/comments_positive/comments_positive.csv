I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. [New picture.](http://imgur.com/Gs5ur)

My dad travels quite a bit for his job, so he is gone for several days at a time. I was watching netflix and she came in my room and sat next to me and started talking about all kinds of shit, how she missed being young bla bla bla - she's in her mid 30's or so. She offered me some pills - i've never done drugs of any kind, but i figured it would be ok since she was giving them to me. I got in weird mood, where i didn't care about anything, i just felt good and fuzzy inside. We laid down and cuddled a bit, i didn't have a care in the world at this points so i decided to try to kiss her. She didn't resist, we made out for a few minutes and then she decided we should stop. I fell asleep with her and several days later we ended up having sex on my dads bed. Now we have sex about 1 or 2 times a week, depending on my dads schedule. |2120|2120|audir8|0

I suck at baking. Every time I've ever tried to make a cake from scratch it sucked. 
But baking is like.. My whole deal. My friends all call me the cake girl. It's like my whole life is a lie. 
People compliment my cakes all the time. Telling me how delicious they are. Telling me it's so much better than box mix cake. Telling me they could never bake a cake so delicious. 
Well guess what? For $1, they too can make a cake just as delicious. Just add oil, eggs and water. 
In my defense, I love cake decorating. I make all of the frostings and fondant from scratch. I just hate baking fucking cakes!! I base my prices mostly on the decoration of the cakes and not of the cake itself of that makes sense. Still...
No one knows about this except my husband. Even my best friends think I fucking slave over the oven mixing and baking these damn cakes. I have been doing this for YEARS. 
If anyone knew my business and reputation would be in the toilet for sure. :/
I keep telling myself I have to learn how to make the damn cakes without the box mixes, but I never do it. I feel like such a sham sometimes. 


Edit-holy shit I didn't expect such a response to this! I feel better about it thanks to a lot of these comments! 

Funny, I started this account as a novelty account and got bored of googling random cakes to post as comments lol
Seemed perfect for this confession!!!


Edit 2: months later I receive messages almost daily on this account. I am so glad I used a throwaway. I forget to check this account most of the time and rarely see this stuff until weeks later. 

That said, to answer the main questions- yes I know I can order cake mix online, but I don't make enough cakes for it to be economical. It's actually more expensive to order online. 
Honestly, I'm not incredibly worried about people seeing me anymore. If I ran into someone I would tell them that I was helping my niece with a bake sale or something. 

I have, since this thread, made some cakes from scratch. I'm still using box mixes for chocolate and vanilla. Oh and red velvet because fuck all of that. 

Let's see what else, oh right, I've received probably 100 comments saying ""The cake is a lie."" We get it. It's very clever, but no, I'm sorry, you're not the first, second, third or twentieth to say it. 

Overall, I've learned this is actually pretty normal. And that people from all over the world have a friend who makes cakes and they all think I am their friend. So far no one has pinned me, but you guys had better check your friend's cabinets for Pilsbury mix ;)"|5349|5349|iGotYouThisCake|0

c4nkycs|t1_c4nksi2|t5_2qh1i|t3_tkx5b|"For the love of....

They are fighting an ideological battle for each other's soul. They are both two sides of the same coin:

Two individuals who, because of a horrible day in their lives, became insane and decided to take on the world and make it in their image.

The joker was a shitty comedian with a pregnant wife, a nice guy. On the day his wife died in a random accident he was bullied by mobsters into committing a crime, fell into a vat of chemicals and ended up alone, in pain, and scarred for life. The overall pain was such that he snapped.... realized that the world is cruel, unjust and random and decided he was going to destroy all fabric of the attempted, false, self-delusional order of the world and break everyone down to his level. He believes morals, ethics, are hypocritical nonsense. You can refer to the Dark Knight movie, in which he says ""I'm just ahead of the curve.""  He spends the entire movie putting everyone in front of him in situations where, to survive, they will have to break their moral code.
Even the henchmen of the black guy... there are two. For no reason other than to break them, he says he will hire the one who will kill the other. 

**This is what the Joker does, he lives to prove to people that he is the avatar of who they really are** : he just refuses to lie to himself.


Batman watched his parents be murdered, went insane also and developed several obsessions, he fights to bring justice to a world he feels is essentially good and plagued by the unnatural disease of crime and evil. He believes in justice above everything else, he does not kill.


**So what happens when these two men face each other?** The Joker's ultimate victory is for the Batman, the strongest enemy of his world view, a person who refuses no matter what to break down to his level, to kill him. He wants the Batman to kill him. He can't wait for Batman to do it. It will prove his point: anyone can be broken into evil, just like him, if their pain or their reasons are strong enough.


Meanwhile the Batman is facing someone who is the epitome of cruelty and senseless crime. He HAS to beat the Joker according to his rules, to prove to himself that his rules mean something, that they are absolute.
And this is a decision he has to face every time he catches the Joker: do I kill him? How many lives will I save if I just kill him? He always escapes Arkham.... I will be doing a good thing by ridding this world of this supremely deranged psychopath. If only he could break his morals in this one case.... *this one time... for the greater good....*


The Joker *knows* this. And he laughs. And he hopes.

But he also has to deal with the temptation... without the Batman he would be virtually unstoppable. Even in the world of DC Comics where there is Super Man, other supervillains fear him. They steer clear of him. He is too unpredictable, chaotic, and cruel. If only he were to kill the Batman, there is nobody out there who understands him enough to be able to stop him. If only he could kill the Batman... everything would be so simple.

They are fighting **a deeply personal, deeply ideological war.** They each represent what the other one hates the most, and they each depend on the other to stay alive until the other bends to his will. 

The last each one of them wants is to kill the other. 

It is poetic.


EDIT: Don't be mistaken, though. Even though the Joker hasn't killed the Batman he has done quite a few fucked up things, incluing flat out killing Jason Todd ( the second Robin) and paralyzing and raping Barbara Gordon ( commissioner Gordon's daughter, who was also Batgirl). He is one... cruel... vicious... motherfucker.

We can bring it back to the launch site, but the boost back penalty is significant. If we also have to the plane change for geo missions from Cape inclination (28.5 deg) to equatorial, then a downrange platform landing is needed.

2. The Mars transport system will be a completely new architecture. Am hoping to present that towards the end of this year. Good thing we didn't do it sooner, as we have learned a huge amount from Falcon and Dragon.

3. Our spacesuit design is finally coming together and will also be unveiled later this year. We are putting a lot of effort into design esthetics, not just utility. It needs to both look like a 21st century spacesuit and work well. Really difficult to achieve both.

"|4904|4904|ElonMuskOfficial|0|t3_2rgsan|"Hi Elon! **I'm asking three questions on behalf of the nearly 20,000-strong fan community /r/SpaceX**. We consider these the best questions we'd like you to answer for us (trust me, there were hundreds more), so a response to each would be much appreciated!

1. Falcon Heavy. Some have speculated that at stage separation the Falcon Heavy center core is too far downrange and travelling too fast to be feasibly returned to the launch site. Could you go into some detail on whether you plan to use barge landings permanently for this core, expend it depending on the mission, or take the payload loss and boost back to the launch site?

2. Mars. Could you please clarify what the Mars Colonial Transporter *actually* is? Is it a crew module like Dragon, a launch vehicle like Falcon, or a mix of both? Does it have inflatable components? Is MCT just a codename?

3. Spacesuits. How does SpaceX plan to address the limitations and contribute to the advancement of current spacesuit technology to best serve humans enroute and on the surface of Mars? You mentioned in 2013 that there'd be an update to SpaceX's ""spacesuit project"" soon - how is it coming along?

Thanks for taking the time to do this AMA! Also at some point, /r/SpaceX would love to have an AMA with someone such as Gwynne Shotwell, Steve Jurvetson, Hans Koenigsmann, or even yourself - so if we could organize something for the future that would be great! And finally, just in case your work and this AMA hasn't already made you aware, you're launching Falcon 9 in less than 12 hours (the 19th SpaceX launch &amp; 14th F9 launch no less!), so here's a [countdown clock](http://spacexstats.com/mission.php?launch=19) &amp; [website](http://spacexstats.com) I built for you.

It's a shoebox, or at least once was, and whenever I masturbate I cum into it. I've had it for two or three years now I think, so it has a fair amount of cum. It smells atrocious, and I tried to burn it once. When I lit it on fire, it was too damp due to the cum that it simply sizzled and didn't manage to actually lite up. Turns out burning cum smells awful, so I had to spray it with a deodorant body spray just to get the old smell of burnt cum away. It also has some drenched papers stuck to it. That's pretty much it.

Because people were asking, [my greatest shame.](http://imgur.com/a/UD5Lo#ZLkrA)

EDIT 2: A lot of people are asking me, why? Well, I'm apparently a rather disturbed individual. But, it just kind of happened, bought new shoes and needed someplace to cum, used the box. It just escalated from there, kept using it each time, telling myself I would throw it out soon. Never did, two or three years later, I still have it. It was planned or anything, it just happened.

EDIT 3: Fuck, this really exploded. ~20,000+ views of my cum box. Did not expect this.

Edit 4: I often get PMed about updates or current status of the box, generally a few a week. So I might as well update this post, if anyone even gets linked here anymore. Current status, I have created life. Mold has begun to grow in the box and has taken over a fair amount. Smells a bit worse, mainly due to a damper apartment so it does not dry as fast, hence the reason why the mold has begun. [New picture.](http://imgur.com/Gs5ur) 

I will never be rid of my need for it. I hate and love the box, just as I hate and love myself.

The life of a crab is crazy. 

Imagine you spent your whole life walking on the ground and watching flying fish above you, envying their freedom and speed. And then all of a sudden a big trap comes out of nowhere and pulls you up, up into the sky - where you've always dreamed of being, flying among the fish - but then even further, past the sky, and into a whole other world above it.

*It's amazing*. What you once thought was the limit of existence has been exceeded. You see the sun clearly for the first time, and it's beaming down on your face. There's a whole other plain above what you once knew, and what's more another sky on top of that - any maybe even countless more above it.

And then suddenly you're dumped into a bucket with other crabs, so close the you can't even move. You're probably upside-down, with somebody else's claw in your face. And a pile more crabs are dumped on top of you.

And then you're shifted around a series of other crowded buckets until finally, briefly, you're given a little aquarium of space. There are tons of other crabs here, but no other fish. It's small, but after all that, you're starting to miss the water and its peaceful existence, and so you think - this isn't so bad. Maybe I can live happily here.

And then someone yanks you out again, boils you to death, cracks open your body and sucks your flesh out.

Only friends could see my pics and I'm only Facebook friends with people that actually know. I have no idea who it was, I can't even imagine. I felt incredibly violated and paranoid. Weird thing is they referred to me by my middle name, which only (as far as I know) a small handful of people would know. Felt totally creeped out and disgusted by the whole thing. |3607|3607|HollyHollyHey|0

Coming this summer: Czech Mates"|4667|4667|bowmessage|0|t3_2tit99|"Oh my. Just oh my. I can already imagine these four in a movie about four misfits being the unlikely candidates to bring down a big drug cartel or something.

The first, the guy on the left, he's the ringleader. He's as close to suave as the rest of these four are going to get, and you can tell because of his almost-sensible haircut and no-nonsense sports jacket.

The guy one in from the left with his leg askew like some kind of deaf Capoeira student, he's the athletic one. About 3/4 of the way into the film, he's going to leap over some barrels or something and knock out a security guard.

The guy beside him, with the hat and the grey sweater, he's the ""hip"" dude with a bit of an attitude. While they're busy infiltrating the cartel's lair, he's going to be the cynical one until he realizes the girl he's been pining for all along works as a double-agent. Double-crossed and scorn, he's going to direct all his attention on bringing the cartel down once and for all.

And the one furthest to the right, with the blue jacket, he's the one who everyone expects so little from. But at the end of the film, after a fallout with the rest of the guys, he'll come back and save the day *just in time,* wrapping up his love-story subplot in the meantime.

You can probably get like a 6.6/10 on IMDb for this."|3931|3931|SirIsaacBrock|0

Ok long story version. This is from my heart and may be important for those who have the same brief chance at happiness, so excuse me please, those redditors who are immersed in cynicism (as I once was).

I had three months off to travel the world.You get this in Oz if you work seven years for same company, its called long service leave.

I go to London and on first day I went to big ben. I want to get the standard tourist shot - me and BB (cheezy but I am an australian and it is the other side of the world!). Was about to ask this guy to take my photo and he lay down on the grass and shut his eyes. 

I turned  to the nearest person. It was a girl reading a paper  and asked  her to take my photo. Got talking to her. Her first day in London too. We decided to have a look around and got lost as both of us  have terrible sense of direction, spent the day immersed in laughter and saw lloyds building about 10 times unintentionally. She was Quebecois and spoke hardly english. Never the less had a blast.

Agreed to meet at Big Ben next day. Next day,  I'm standing there and thinking, ""who is that beautiful girl waving at me""... Turned out to be the girl from the day before. To be honest the first day I hadn't really though much about her looks as I was jet lagged to hell and  thought it was just a few hour wander around london before we went our separate ways. 

She'd come to london to learn english, ended up running away with me and we travelled all over europe, living in a tent and surviving on pancakes and cheap wine. After three months of sunshine and adventure, we parted as she had to go back to quebec to study and finish her degree. I had career and masters to finish on other side of the world. I had never had three months of my life that were filled with so much happiness and felt very lucky to have shared this time together with someone so special. 

Try as I might, I couldn't get her off my mind. All my friends said 'forget it, just a holiday romance - it would never work in real life'. I talked to others who'd tried to rekindle these sorts of romances and it had failed. The time had been so great that I didnt want to spoil it with some clumsy attempt to recapture the magic. After all 9-5 is very different to hanging out in france and spain.

About a year later I got a lump in my side.  I was diagnosed with aggressive cancer. I remember sitting in the doctors surgery and thinking 'this cant be happening - I havent finished my masters yet!'. I was trying to joke with the doctor and he wouldn't smile and he told me that if it had got into my system I probably had one more year. This was a very dark period, but also it made me think very deeply about life, my priorities and how precious time is.

I had to go into  hospital and have the thing cut out immediately. Lay in bed afterwards and vowed that if I made it through I would track the girl down and ask for her hand in marriage. Long story short, I made it through.

So I sent a postcard to an old address she gave me . Someone read the back of it and realised it might be important and got it to her.

Well, she said 'Yes""

We have now been together for ten years, still the most amazing woman in the world and as beautiful as when I first met her. We still have no sense of direction and as a result have got wonderfully lost all over the world together.

This is the reason for my reddit name - because on the front of the card I sent her was a picture of me holding a sign saying 'risk everything'

I dont know why it is that some get the chance to meet someone so special. I wish it could happen to everyone. 

Having walked through the dark valley and also having won the hand of the woman I loved , I value every single day. 

tldr: If you get a chance at love 'risk everything'
