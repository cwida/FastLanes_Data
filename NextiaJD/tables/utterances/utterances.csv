57264|9|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|It's a 2,200-mile race. To give some sense of perspective, that's roughly the distance between Washington, D.C. and Las Vegas. They do it over the course of three weeks at very fast speeds. But incredibly, oftentimes the distance between first and second is somewhere between and one and three minutes.
57264|10|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|So for a top competitor like Lance to try to make up that much time -he's now 13 minutes, 26 seconds behind the current race leader, Cadel Evans of Australia. And even Lance said yesterday that for him, the -any chance of winning the tour has gone out the window. He still does have a teammate on his team, RadioShack team, American Levi Leipheimer currently in eighth place, two minutes, 14 seconds back. And Lance is going to do what he can to help Leipheimer do well.
57264|11|NEAL CONAN, host|So in every team, presumably there's one star, one equivalent to Lance Armstrong and the other team - the rest of the teammates project him, do what they can to help him succeed?
57264|12|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's right. Each team has nine riders. And what you have is basically the team leader, sort of your queen bee, and then eight worker bees working to keep that queen safe and happy for when the decisive moments of the race come. In cycling, a lot of the energy goes toward actually battling wind resistance. So if you're riding behind another rider, you can be using up to 30 percent less energy because you're in that slipstream of the rider who's battling the wind. So team riders will ride on the front, protect their leader. You'll often see a team member drift back to the team car to fetch water bottles to keep their leader well hydrated.
57264|13|NEAL CONAN, host|So slipstream, this is like drafting in car racing, right?
57264|14|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's exactly right.
57264|15|NEAL CONAN, host|And so the guy who's in back has an easier time. And even when there are people in front on a breakaway, for example, who are from different teams, three or four riders, you will see them switch back and forth rather congenially so the same person isn't in front all the time.
57264|16|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's right. There's a lot of deal making that can go on in those breakaways. And oftentimes, they'll share the work until a time when they've determined it's every man for himself. But up until then, they form a sort of de facto team. And then sometimes you can see they've actually decided who might be able to win the stage that day. And these wagers can be for anything, for future favors, for money, for other things that they determine are valuable.
57264|17|NEAL CONAN, host|We're talking with Loren Mooney, the editor-in-chief of Bicycling Magazine. She's at our bureau in New York. Why do you watch the Tour de France? So we want to hear from our bicycling audience today. 800-989-8255. Email us: talk@npr.org. And we'll start with John(ph), John with us from San Francisco.
57264|18|JOHN (Caller)|Hello.
57264|19|NEAL CONAN, host|Hi, John.
57264|20|JOHN (Caller)|Yeah, the bicycle - or the Tour de France for me is just kind of the ultimate extension of what can be done with the bicycle. The bicycle is the most efficient form of transportation as far as energy spent for a single human being. And to me, the tour is just - takes it to the utmost what can - or what are the outer limits of what one man can do with this machine. It kind of puts it all at the very top limit of what's possible.
57264|21|NEAL CONAN, host|The ultimate expression - the training that you have to do for this, John, though is pretty ferocious.
57264|22|JOHN (Caller)|That also. But if you try to think of how long it would take anyone to cover the same distance by foot or the amount of energy spent in any other way for these guys to go 3,000 miles in three weeks, it's kind of unfathomable without the machine itself.
57264|23|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's true. It's interesting, too, these guys, they are very efficient in their energy use. But the amount of energy that they're using for human capacity can be fairly stunning. These guys are burning anywhere between six and 9,000 calories every day just to move their bicycles over the terrain. Nine thousand calories is the upper limits on some of those more difficult mountain stages. And that's more than the average American should eat in four-plus days to give you some sense of scale. These guys turn into very high-burning engines, if you will.
57264|24|NEAL CONAN, host|In other words, don't invite them out to dinner.
57264|25|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Yeah. You'd be - if you have to pick up the tab, you'd be in some trouble for sure.
57264|26|NEAL CONAN, host|John, thanks very much for the call.
57264|27|JOHN (Caller)|Thank you.
57264|28|NEAL CONAN, host|Bye-bye. There is also, as we mentioned, the training. But one of the aspects of the race that seems to startle a lot of people is they're riding through these little towns in France, for the most part, and people are standing right by the roadsides. There's no barriers. They just reach out and touch them, and sometimes they do.
57264|29|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's right. One of the very cool things about the sport is it does give the public a chance to really go face to face with the riders on the roadway. Sometimes on those steep climbs, you'll see just walls of people almost blocking the road and then moving back at the last second to let the riders slip through. Given the access that the fans have - and there can be, you know, hundreds of thousands, close to a million people on some of these larger mountainsides - it is remarkable that there's not more interference from fans.
57264|30|NEAL CONAN, host|Let's go next to Marshall(ph), Marshall with us from Holland, Michigan.
57264|31|MARSHALL (Caller)|Hello. The reason I watch the Tour de France is because this is the best time for a cyclist like myself, an amateur racer, to enjoy top-notch live coverage. Otherwise, it's all by magazines or over the Internet.
57264|32|NEAL CONAN, host|The magazines are, of course, brilliant.
57264|33|MARSHALL (Caller)|Pardon?
57264|34|NEAL CONAN, host|The magazines are brilliant.
57264|35|MARSHALL (Caller)|Magazines are brilliant, and I do have a subscription to Bicycling Magazine.
57264|36|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Oh, okay.
57264|37|MARSHALL (Caller)|But it's the best because you have every type of racing that you can enjoy. You have the mountains. You have sprinting. And you have time trials. So no matter what kind of cyclist you are, you get to watch all the world's greatest cyclists in one, you know, one three-week race. And it's the best. It's - I devour it every night and find excuses to be at home during the day to watch it live.
57264|38|NEAL CONAN, host|One of interesting things, Marshall, that I find is the races within the races. So you have races that are sprints and people competing for the sprint championship, and then races within the mountains and people competing to be the King of the Mountains.
57264|39|MARSHALL (Caller)|Those are great because it actually allows you to pay attention on individual stages more so than the overall. While the overall is the top prize, the King of the Mountains and the sprint's jersey, even the young rider jersey, which is the white jersey, are prized. And among sprinters, which is my favorite competition, that's awesome because the speed that they hit, 45, 47, almost 50 kilometers an hour for huge amount of wattage, it's just amazing.
57264|40|NEAL CONAN, host|Hmm. Marshall, thanks very much for the phone call. Appreciate it.
57264|41|MARSHALL (Caller)|You bet.
57264|42|NEAL CONAN, host|The jerseys, he mentioned, of course, the yellow jersey is the overall leader, but the other categories have all jerseys of their own, Loren Mooney.
57264|43|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Yeah, that's right. The yellow jersey, the overall leader, and that is the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the three weeks. The green sprinter's jersey, determined by points, often who has the best sprint at the end. But there are also some intermediate sprints during some stages. The polka dot jersey is for the best mountain climber. And the white jersey is for the best rider 25 years of age or under.
57264|44|NEAL CONAN, host|Let's go next to Rick(ph), Rick with us from Denver.
57264|45|RICK (Caller)|Hello. How are you today?
57264|46|NEAL CONAN, host|Good, thanks.
57264|47|RICK (Caller)|Great. Hey, I just - I love hearing a show about the Tour de France and I truly love watching it. And as a former cyclist, I spent four years after high school, before I started college, racing bikes. But I would propose that there are two reasons why people love watching the tour, and I'd love to hear your guest's comments on these. Number one is the cinematography is incredible. I mean, you really - you don't just watch a bike race when you watch the tour each morning. You get a chance to see some of the most beautiful scenery. And just the way they present it on TV, it's much more than just a sporting event.
57264|48|RICK (Caller)|And the second reason I would propose people love watching the Tour de France is Mr. Phil Liggett. It's - the British gentleman who speaks to us each morning, not just about the race and the current riders whom he seems to know each one of them personally, but about the history of the race, the history of France, the history of cycling, the history of whatever you like. Phil just seems to have so many stories that fill what is a very long day.
57264|49|RICK (Caller)|I mean, these races on television are quite long. And yet, you never get bored because each time he starts speaking he's got another little tidbit to share with you. So...
57264|50|NEAL CONAN, host|Well...
57264|51|RICK (Caller)|...I find that the cinematography and Phil just leave me gripped to the TV.
57264|52|NEAL CONAN, host|I thought this call originally from the French Ministry of Tourism. But it turns out, of course, he was publicity department at Versus, so...
57264|53|RICK (Caller)|Well, I would love to know what your guest thinks of my proposal that those are two reasons why people continue to watch the tour despite many of the troubles that the athletes seem to create for themselves.
57264|54|NEAL CONAN, host|Loren?
57264|55|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Yeah. I think that's right, particularly with the scenery of France. It is a true tour of the country. The route changes each year. Some years, it goes in a counterclockwise circle around France. This year going clockwise, where it's hitting the Alps mountains before the Pyrenees. And you're seeing tiny villages. You're seeing just breathtaking mountainscapes. You go into the Pyrenees, you see the Basque flags and the fans wearing orange, cheering.
57264|56|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|And also, the cinematography that they're using at this point is outstanding. You're seeing not only the wide shots from helicopters, but these cameramen on motorbikes within the race are the true daredevils of the race. They get some amazing footage.
57264|57|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|You're also seeing in some of the sprint stages now, they have a camera that goes alongside the racers at upwards of 50 miles an hour, sometimes at the very end to see the very last rocket ship efforts of the sprinters. So really covering it from all angles, again, getting up close, getting into the riders' faces at the moment of the action is pretty remarkable stuff.
57264|58|NEAL CONAN, host|Rick, thanks very much for the call.
57264|59|RICK (Caller)|Thank you.
57264|60|NEAL CONAN, host|The current issue of Bicycling Magazine offers a 2010 Tour de France fans guide. Its editor-in-chief, Loren Mooney, is with us. You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.
57264|61|NEAL CONAN, host|And here's some emails that we have. This from Matt(ph) in Liverpool, New York. Personally, couldn't name five riders, but I love to see the French countryside. And this is from Amon(ph) in Sunnyvale, California. As an Irishman I was inspired by the great Sean Kelly and Stephen Roche in the 1980s. Roche began as a paperboy racing his friends delivering newspapers in Dublin when he was a kid. He went on to win the Tour de France in a dramatic finish against Spaniard Pedro Delgado in 1987, the first and only Irishman ever to do so.
57264|62|NEAL CONAN, host|I'm 35 years old and still racing for the Los Gatos Club here in California, Greg LeMond's old club. So that's, of course, the other great American rider before Lance Armstrong.
57264|63|NEAL CONAN, host|And this is from Greg(ph) in Oklahoma City. It's a sporting event like no other. Unlike any other sport, it involves individual team -individual and team goals, none of which can be realized without the other. It has history, courage, teamwork and a host of unpredictable variables. I watch every day on the edge of my couch. Let's see if can go next to - this is Sterling(ph), Sterling with us from St. Helena in California.
57264|64|STERLING (Caller)|How are you all today?
57264|65|NEAL CONAN, host|Very well, thanks.
57264|66|STERLING (Caller)|Fantastic. Loren, love your magazine. You know, I think one of the things that's - that one of your callers mentioned, you know, in the dual proposal, you do get to see such an amazing part of the world and you could see it in great detail. But I think the thing that really draws me is the community that gets created every year when the tour is broadcast. The communities of cyclists and triathletes out, you know, all throughout the United States all gather together and, you know, discuss this, talk about this.
57264|67|STERLING (Caller)|I was in a bike shop yesterday in Napa Valley and getting my bike work done and a 71-year-old woman walked in and said, you know, I want to buy a bike. You know, I was watching the tour and I want to get out on my bike. And, you know, I happen to have a 74-year-old mother who's got a Trek carbon bike and, you know, she's all inspired. And I think that's the thing that's so compelling is the sense of community, you know, these 20-something days create, you know, in the U.S.
57264|68|STERLING (Caller)|And it's not - you don't see that. I mean, I think you'd see that in the World Cup with football but - soccer, but you don't see that in any other sports where people get together and they're really - it's participatory as well.
57264|69|NEAL CONAN, host|Well, the sport, Loren Mooney, has a natural clubhouse, the bike shop.
57264|70|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|That's true. The bike shop is our clubhouse, sports bar, church, all in one for the cyclists. And I think you're absolutely right. You drew the World Cup analogy there. And I think that's a good one because cycling, much like soccer in the U.S., is rarely shown on television with, you know, with any - in any depth. And so, this is our time to celebrate much like you saw the rather large soccer community in the U.S. gathering in sports bars watching the World Cup.
57264|71|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|This is the time when the cyclists gather together, watch, stop by the bike shop afterward, get into friendly arguments. It's funny how many times just this year I have watched the Tour de France live on TV, then gone out for a bike ride and I see a lot of other cyclists leaving at the same time, knowing that they had just watched the stage as well and now are free for the rest of their day to go out and do their own bike ride.
57264|72|NEAL CONAN, host|Sterling, thanks very much for the call. Appreciate it.
57264|73|STERLING (Caller)|Yeah.
57264|74|NEAL CONAN, host|"Email from Sean(ph) in Cleveland. The Tour de France reminds me of what the human body can achieve with massive amounts of dedication. Lance is my hero. All of these riders are my hero. And this is from Robert(ph) in Columbus, Ohio. Because it inspires me to write and because, quote, ""you're not having fun until you're not having fun."" And I suppose that last part is because it drives you to do things you didn't think you could do."
57264|75|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Yeah, absolutely. I think the tour is widely called the most difficult endurance event in the world. It's funny when you look at some of these racers, you look at them at the beginning of the Tour de France and at the end of the Tour de France, it's to me not unlike when you see a president about to finish his eighth year, end of the second term of office. And you look back at a photograph of the first inauguration and you realize just how much the president has aged in those eight years.
57264|76|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|You look at a Tour de France rider first day and then on the podium in Paris, and they almost look like a different person. They're very gaunt. Their whole body composition has changed just from having been through the rigors of the event.
57264|77|NEAL CONAN, host|Loren Mooney, thanks very much for your time today. We appreciate it.
57264|78|Ms. LOREN MOONEY (Editor-in-Chief, Bicycling Magazine)|Thank you.
57264|79|NEAL CONAN, host|And good watching. Loren Mooney is editor-in-chief of Bicycling Magazine and joined us from our bureau in New York.
57264|80|NEAL CONAN, host|I'm Neal Conan. This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News. Join us tomorrow.
58225|1|NEAL CONAN, host|This is TALK OF THE NATION. Im Neal Conan in Washington.
58225|2|NEAL CONAN, host|The U.S. Supreme Court handed down rulings in two important cases earlier today. First, in a seven-to-two decision, the high court agreed that the government can indefinitely hold convicts considered sexually dangerous, even after their prison terms are complete.
58225|3|NEAL CONAN, host|In the second case, decided five to four, the court said it is cruel and unusual punishment to sentence minors to life without the possibility of parole if murder is not involved.
58225|4|NEAL CONAN, host|"Later in the program, a comic book also-ran sprints to the top of the movie box office charts. Glen Weldon joins us on ""Iron Man 2."" But first, the Supreme Court rulings."
58225|5|NEAL CONAN, host|If either of these cases affects you, give us a call. Tell us how, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation via our website. Thats at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.
58225|6|NEAL CONAN, host|We begin with David Savage, who covers the court for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. He joins us today by phone from his office. David, always good to have you with us. Thanks for your time.
58225|7|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Hi, Neal.
58225|8|NEAL CONAN, host|And let's take these one at a time. A solid majority ruled it's constitutional to hold a convict even after he completes his sentence.
58225|9|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Yes, and Neal, this case actually was not a dispute about what you might think it was about, which is: Is that fair?
58225|10|NEAL CONAN, host|Yeah.
58225|11|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|About 15 years ago, in a case from Kansas, the court upheld these after-the-fact punishments involving sexual criminals. They said that they were not retroactive, and it was not a violation of due process of law.
58225|12|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|So it's actually been clear for a while as a constitutional matter, as a matter of individual rights. The government could hold somebody after they served their term...
58225|13|NEAL CONAN, host|Because of what they might do.
58225|14|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Correct. Last year, however, a federal appeals court struck down the federal law on the grounds that Congress didn't have the authority to pass such a law. There is no federal police power, they say, and that Congress only has the powers that are in the Constitution, the power to regulate interstate commerce.
58225|15|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|What the court said today, with Stephen Breyer writing a very broad opinion, was that Congress can pass laws that are necessary and proper to carry out its aims. And he wrote an opinion that said any law that's sort of rationally related to some aim that Congress has, it is constitutional.
58225|41|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|You said it better, Neal.
75004|1|LIANE HANSEN, host|The Atlantic hurricane season officially ends today. In the United States, 2008 likely will be remembered as a moderately bad year for storms. But in Cuba, this season will go down as perhaps the worst season ever. NPR's Jon Hamilton has the story.
75004|2|JON HAMILTON|Eight hurricanes formed in the North Atlantic and Caribbean this year. Three of them, all major storms, hit Cuba. Alexis Fernandez(ph) was in Baracoa, a city on the eastern tip of Cuba, when Hurricane Ike made landfall on September 7.
75004|3|Mr. ALEXIS FERNANDEZ (History Teacher)|(Through Translator) The waves were as high as top of the buildings, and some of those buildings were five stories high. This in turn started the destruction of homes, people's homes that were along the beach area. Homes that people had worked all their lives for were lost in a matter of minutes.
75004|4|JON HAMILTON|Fernandez teaches history at the University in Baracoa. He says more than 6,000 homes were damaged and hundreds destroyed. Ike would go on to scour the entire length of Cuba before moving into the Gulf of Mexico. A couple of weeks earlier, Hurricane Gustav had plowed across the western part of the country. And in early November, Hurricane Paloma struck the central coast near Santa Cruz del Sur. Fernandez says it's been the worst year for hurricanes in his lifetime.
75004|5|Mr. ALEXIS FERNANDEZ (History Teacher)|(Through Translator) In the '60s, we suffered a lot from Hurricane Flora. There were great floods. There were hundreds of deaths. In this series of hurricanes, there's been a lot of economic damage. But in human life, it hasn't been as bad because the state has been able to control and help us evacuate, so that the damage in human lives is minimal.
75004|6|JON HAMILTON|The storms did more than $10 billion of damage in Cuba and left tens of thousands homeless. But only a handful of people died. One reason is Cuba's highly organized evacuation system. Another reason is that Cuban meteorologists work closely with their U.S. counterparts to forecast and track storms. Cuba even allows U.S. hurricane hunter aircraft to fly into Cuban airspace. And then there's Cuba's chief hurricane forecaster, Jose Rubiera.
75004|7|_NO_SPEAKER|(Soundbite of hurricane forecaster Jose Rubiera on Cuban TV)
75004|8|JON HAMILTON|That's Rubiera on Cuban television describing Ike. He's a fixture on Cuban TV anytime a storm is on the way, and viewers pay attention to his warnings. Caribbean nations with less expertise and infrastructure were badly hurt by hurricanes this season. In Haiti, hundreds of people died. In the U.S. this year, hurricanes struck Texas and Louisiana. Hurricane Ike regained much of its strength after passing over Cuba. Then it weakened to a category two storm before making landfall near Galveston, Texas. Even so, Ike killed more than 80 people in the U.S. and caused damage of more than $25 billion. Gerry Bell is the lead seasonal forecaster at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. He says there are several reasons Ike was so dangerous, even though its wind speeds weren't that high.
75004|9|Dr. GERRY BELL (Meteorologist, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)|The tremendous storm surge, the very long track over water where the hurricane could really, really pile up the water, also the speed of movement of the storm. If it's a slow moving hurricane, it's going to stay over any given area longer and obviously increase the potential for more damage.
75004|10|JON HAMILTON|Hurricane Gustav strengthened to a category three storm in the Gulf of Mexico. Officials evacuated New Orleans, and residents feared another Katrina. But Gustav ultimately weakened to a category two storm and veered west of New Orleans. At the start of the hurricane season, Gerry Bell had predicted a busy year. And he was right.
75004|11|Dr. GERRY BELL (Meteorologist, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)|We had 16 named storms, eight hurricanes, and five major hurricanes. And that's certainly consistent with what the forecasts were for a lot of activity this season.
75004|12|JON HAMILTON|Bell says it's too soon to say much about next year, but he adds that the Atlantic is in a period of high hurricane activity that's likely to continue for another decade or more. Jon Hamilton, NPR News.
74884|1|SCOTT SIMON, host|Not a week goes by there isn't some story about endangered newspapers or layoffs in the broadcasting and entertainment industry. Now there's bad news from the world of publishing, where major houses have laid off staff, restructured management, limited the number of manuscripts they buy. Charlotte Abbott is a contributing editor for Publishers Weekly and joins us from New York. Thanks so much for being with us.
74884|2|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|Thanks for having me, Scott.
74884|3|SCOTT SIMON, host|So, what's business like this year?
74884|4|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|Book sales have definitely slipped.
74884|5|SCOTT SIMON, host|What's your analysis of what's driven sales down then?
74884|6|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|Well, the general retail falloff, I think, has had a big, big effect. Interestingly, children's fiction is stronger than the rest of the book publishing categories. I think people do not feel that books are a luxury for children, perhaps the way they might for adults. And I also hear that libraries are seeing a lot of activities. So I think it's not that people are not reading, it's that they're not buying books and are finding other ways to get their reading fix satisfied, except in the case of children where they are buying books.
74884|7|SCOTT SIMON, host|Well, that raises this question. We've seen the introduction of electronic readers - eBooks, the Kindle from Amazon, and the Sony Reader. How are they selling? Does this represent a whole new movement in the book industry?
74884|8|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|It does in some ways. I think it's very notable, certainly. And as far as price point goes, eBooks are certainly the cheaper option, coming in about six or seven dollars per book. EBook sales are up as much as 300 percent for many of the major houses. But that's in a context where eBooks are still representing still under about one percent of total book sales.
74884|9|SCOTT SIMON, host|May I press you a bit about some of these new technologies?
74884|10|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|Sure.
74884|11|SCOTT SIMON, host|Because I can remember a time when people thought that, you know, nothing would replace the newspaper. And obviously, a lot of people have found some kind of replacement for newspapers - online and through other media. And then, you know, I've talked to recording industry executives who've said, we'd love to get out of the hardware business - you know, all the making CDs, making the tamperproof covers. Now, as I don't have to tell you, in books, to print them, to sell them is expensive and speculative. Can books really expect even for 10 years to not be subject to technological changes?
63416|18|XENI JARDIN|The software analysis all of those human factors and processes them with algorithms.  That information generally won't help right there, during that call, but Schaffer says it can be used to answer important questions companies may have.
63416|19|Ms. ROBIN SCHAFFER (NICE Systems)|What kinds of situations - what kind of topics are bringing up this kind of level of emotion.  And it could go down to the soft skills or particular agents that seem to have patterns of customers becoming more emotional.  Or it could come to broad business issues, that - where you can notice a pattern between heighten emotions and a particular product or service, or geographic area, or some other very important business component.
63416|20|XENI JARDIN|Phil Tschudy is from CUNA Mutual a financial services group in Madison, Wisconsin that processes thousands of calls a day.
63416|21|XENI JARDIN|He says his company has been trying out the software for about a year as a feedback tool.
63416|22|Mr. PHIL TSCHUDY (CUNA Mutual)|This is an opportunity for us to go back and make sure that we're looking for trends that can be addressed, that we can help our call center representatives improve the services they deliver.
63416|23|Mr. PHIL TSCHUDY (CUNA Mutual)|And I think ultimately consumers want that, and demands are higher than they have every been.  And so this is great tool for us to really understand what are customers want and then deliver on that - on those expectations.
63416|24|XENI JARDIN|This idea sounds great, but there is some problems. Big companies want to cut costs, so more phone support has been outsourced to call centers overseas.  But the issue is that English may not be a first language for most of the reps answering phones.  And if a communication gap grows wider another automated solution probably won't go far enough to comfort the outraged and unhappy customer.  For NPR News, I'm Xeni Jardin.

68175|0|IRA FLATOW, host|This is Talk of The Nation: Science Friday.  I'm Ira Flatow.  We're here in Tucson, Arizona, and if you've ever visited this part of the country, you know it can get really hot.  And I'm not talking about the weather, I'm talking about the food from Jalapenos to Anaheim's, to Poblano's, folks in this part of that world have been spicing their food with chilies for centuries.
68175|1|IRA FLATOW, host|But something I learned on this trip out West is that chilies don't just make food hot, there are lots of mild ones too that are used in cooking, and chilies have non-food uses too.  We'll talk about all the uses for chilies, you know, for example their signature chemical compound, capsaicin.
68175|2|IRA FLATOW, host|That stuff that makes them hot is also used for a pain reliever.  I see your shaking your head, you knew that.  Yes.  And their color is used in cosmetics with lipsticks, did you know that too?  Well, well, what's about - that's why we're here for, to talk about chilies and everything that you ever wanted to know about chilies, so we're going to kick off the hour talking about chili peppers, what makes them hot and why do we like them.
68175|3|IRA FLATOW, host|Why do we like something that's that hot for us, and burns or maybe doesn't burn our tongues?  And how are farmers and scientists working together to take the plants from seed to fruit and back to seed, then here we are.  In the audience in Tucson, Arizona, talking to folks, and if you'd like to join us please step up to the microphone when the - when it hits you.
68175|4|IRA FLATOW, host|The appeal to ask a question?  Also, our number, 1-800-989-8255, 1-800-989-TALK, and in Second Life you can find us in Science Friday Island, and look for our seating area there and ask a question to Second Life.  Let me introduce my guest.  Jeff Silvertooth is a professor and the head of the Plant Scientist Department at the University of Arizona in Tucson.  Thanks for talking to us today.
68175|5|Dr. JEFF SILVERTOOTH (Professor and Head, Plant Scientist Department, University of Arizona, Tucson)|Thank you.
68175|6|IRA FLATOW, host|Good to have you here.  Ed Curry is a farmer and owner of the Curry Seed and Chile Company in Pearce, Arizona.  Thank you, Ed.
68175|7|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|Thank you.
68175|8|IRA FLATOW, host|And in fact, we have a little bit of a tour of Ed's Chili farm just outside of Tucson.  It's sciencefriday.com.  Flora Lichtman, our digital producer put it together, and if you'd like to see a little preview of the full-blown version, you can go over to our website at sciencefriday.com, to see a bit of Ed's farm.
68175|9|IRA FLATOW, host|"Gary Nabhan is a research social scientist at the University of Arizona, he's also the author of ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity.""  And he joins us from WMEA in Portland, Maine.  Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Nabhan."
68175|10|"Dr. GARY NABHAN (Researcher Social Scientist, University of Arizona; Author, ""Why Some Like it Hot:  Food, Genes, and Cultural Diversity"")"|Happy to be here with you.
68175|11|IRA FLATOW, host|Thank you.  Ed, when we say chili?  What are we talking about?  It was a - it encompasses a lot of stuff, doesn't it?
68175|12|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|It does.  Probably the simplest explanation for chili is obviously as a lot of countries have their own specific chilies, but here in The Southwest, long, green, once termed Anaheim, because they were so popular there around Anaheim, California. They responded to the cool weather and next to the ocean there...
68175|13|IRA FLATOW, host|Mm-hm.
68175|14|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|But long green chili, Dr. Paul Smith from U.C. Davis gave it that name, suggested that name some years ago.  So long, green chili indicates a relatively mild, flavorful chili.
68175|15|IRA FLATOW, host|Mm-hm.  There are lots of different varieties and brands of things like that, that you can get?
68175|16|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|Of the long green?
68175|17|IRA FLATOW, host|Yeah.
68175|18|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|Of the long green alone, there's several. We - my partner Phil V. and I have bred the several different strands of just the long green alone.  But, when you get outside of the long green, the - in the Capsaicum annum species...
68175|19|IRA FLATOW, host|Right.
68175|20|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|It's huge, there's just all kinds.
68175|21|IRA FLATOW, host|Mm-hm.  Jeff, South - the Eastern Arizona is part of what is called the Chili Belt, and I don't think I've ever heard that phrase until I got here.  What does that mean?  Why is this a great spot to grow chilies?
67560|19|MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST|UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: We could hear all of the teachers screaming. I think someone got shot in the chest, and they kept yelling, put some pressure on it.

68670|1|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|"The partial government shutdown appears to be coming to an end three days after it began. The breakthrough came when Democrats led by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to fund the government until February 8. That's a little under three weeks from now. In exchange, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pledged to take action on immigration. Beyond that, there aren't a lot of details. In a statement, President Trump said he's pleased the Democrats have come to their senses. He says once the government is funded, his administration will work toward a long-term deal on immigration but, quote, ""if and only if it's good for our country."""
68670|2|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson is at the White House to talk about all of this. Hey, Mara.
68670|3|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|Hi there.
68670|4|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|Just first to make sure we know what's happening, where do things stand now?
68670|5|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|Where things stand now is that both houses of Congress have passed another short-term funding bill which gives Democrats, Republicans and the president a three-week reprieve. They now have until February 8 to figure out a deal on DACA, which is the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. This was protection from deportation for immigrants who were brought here as children, many of them illegally.
68670|6|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|President Trump has removed that protection, and he gave Congress until March 5 to figure out a solution, or else these DACA recipients would be subject to deportation. If a deal on DACA can't be reached by February 8, according to Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, his intention would be to let the issue go to the Senate floor.
68670|7|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|As we look back on these three days, this partial shutdown, I mean, which party comes out of the whole thing a winner?
68670|8|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|The White House feels very confident that they won this round. The Trump campaign is already sending around a fundraising email saying Democrats caved. The president's son on Fox today said the shutdown has been good for us. And it's true. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, didn't get that much when he agreed to this deal except for an extension of the Children's Health Program for six years. And a lot of left-wing groups who are part of the Democrats' base agree with the White House. They think Schumer gave in too easily.
68670|9|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|But whatever the political victory for the Republicans is, it's probably a short-term one because when the conversation was about shutting down the government on behalf of people in the country illegally, Democrats were losing the debate. But when the conversation turns back to what should be done about DACA recipients, Democrats are on firmer ground because vast majorities of Americans think those young people should have a path to citizenship.
68670|10|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|One of the issues that was reported - that came out that, you know, Democrats and Republicans didn't necessarily know where President Trump stood on this. And Senator Schumer said over the weekend, negotiating with President Trump is like negotiating with Jell-O. I think what - people are wondering why the president wasn't more involved in the conversation.
68670|11|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|Well, that's a good question, and the White House was very intent on pushing back against this notion that the president was a kind of bystander and uninvolved in the weekend negotiations over the shutdown. Here's White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.
68670|12|_NO_SPEAKER|(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)
68670|13|SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS|Look; what the president did clearly worked. The vote just came in 81-18. I would say that those numbers are much more in the president's favor than in Senator Schumer's favor.
68670|14|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|So we still don't know exactly what the president wants in a final deal, but we know at least in terms of this particular skirmish the president got a tactical victory. He gets to take credit, which he really likes to do.
68670|15|KELLY MCEVERS, HOST|NPR's Mara Liasson at the White House, thanks a lot.
68670|16|MARA LIASSON, BYLINE|Thank you.
70039|34|NEAL CONAN, host|For listeners who did not hear the initial broadcast, a little difficult to understand what the complaint was about unless we played the offending piece of tape.
74884|12|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|Phrased that way, I don't think so, no. I think that eBooks will continue to grow. Experientially right now, the only place that I really see people reading them, using the Kindle or the Sony Reader, these electronic book-reading devices, is either on the subway in New York City where you have, you know, certainly a group who can afford these technologies and who, you know, can use them in public. And then also for business travelers - again an audience with disposable income, who is space conscious and technologically adept.
74884|13|Ms. CHARLOTTE ABBOTT (Contributing Editor, Publishers Weekly)|I do agree that there are certain kinds of books that may find their audiences eroded. We've already seen this. A certain kind of current affairs book - you know, the torn from the headlines story - enough of that is available on TV or in excerpts or online. People can blog now and tell their story directly to their audience. They don't have to have the intervention of a book, the way that they used to. So I do see some erosion there. I do see that there will continue to be an audience and a readership for books as objects as well. The book is still a technology that works really well. You can get it wet, and the most it'll do is wrinkle. You can slip it in your purse or your pocket. It works.

75394|1|MADELEINE BRAND, host|From NPR West, this is DAY TO DAY.  Alex Chadwick is away.  I'm Madeleine      Brand.
75394|2|MADELEINE BRAND, host|Coming up, why Democrats are divided on Iraq.  But first, minutes before      today's midnight deadline, the Iraqi parliament has reviewed a draft      constitution, but they've concluded that there are still outstanding      issues left to be resolved, and they say they'll take the next three days      to do that. Dan Murphy is a reporter for The Christian Science Monitor in      Baghdad.  I spoke with him earlier about the remaining issues.
75394|3|MADELEINE BRAND, host|The main stumbling blocks, as we know them, are federalism, the      role of Islam, especially the rights of women, and how to distribute the      oil wealth in Iraq.  Has there been any progress in the last week on any      of those issues?
75394|4|Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor)|It depends on who you're      talking to.  You're right that those are the main stumbling blocks, but      an additional main stumbling block is the Sunni Arab minority, who are      very underrepresented in parliament.  And, of course, Sunni Arabs are      behind most of the insurgent activity here.  And they don't want to sign      off on a constitution.  There seems as if there's been a progress between      Kurds and Shiites who are sort of the dominant political forces in this      process.  The Sunnis don't want to sign off at all, and so as we go      towards this deadline in a few hours here, the Kurds and the Shiites are      talking to the press and saying, `We think we've got it all stitched up.      We've got a draft we can live with,' and the Sunnis are saying, `No way.      If you push this through over our heads, there's going to be more blood      here.  Please don't do this.'  What we don't know is whether or not the      Shiites and the Kurds will push ahead on that basis.
75394|5|MADELEINE BRAND, host|Well, speaking of more blood and more violence, you've written      that some political observers say there's a de facto civil war going on      in Iraq, and that one way to address that is to put some sort of peace      treaty in this constitution.  Is there any move to do that?
75394|6|Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor)|Well, there is a civil war here.  I don't know what anybody      would call it if not that.  But the problem is is that usually, you know,      constitutions are written and new compacts are made about the nature of      states when the wars end.  It's very unusual for these sorts of things to      be sorted out right now.  I don't think there's any chance that this      constitution--if it is, in fact, finished today or in the next week--is      going to be satisfying to the warring parties here.  While we do have      Sunnis sitting at the table negotiating with Kurds and Shiites, it's not      clear to us if any of them, or how many of them, represent the people on      the Sunni Arab side who are carrying guns and fighting in the insurgency      here.  So even if they end up cutting deals with the Kurd and Shiite      partners here, it's not clear that that's going to see other Sunni Arabs      put their guns down.  So we're a long way away from the sort of peace      process and the peace compact that a place like Iraq would need to      stabilize.
75394|7|MADELEINE BRAND, host|Well, is there anything that those Sunni Arabs would want to see      done with this constitution, or are they so far out of the political      process it doesn't matter?
75394|8|Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor)|I mean, there's two problems for them.  Number one is      they're aware that they have a very, almost nihilistically violent side      to their own constituency, and they're, frankly, afraid of getting killed      if they sign anything away that's going to be unpopular with those people      who very well may be a minority but a very powerful minority at the      moment.
75394|9|Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor)|The other issue is is that Sunnis didn't participate in the January 30th      elections.  So in this process and in this interim parliament, you know,      they count almost no seats at all, and they probably make up anywhere      from 20 to 30 percent of the population.  What they would really like is      to delay and delay and delay until this interim parliament collapses and      new elections are held so that they could have an election, participate      in that election in greater numbers and have a lot more real political      influence.  Of course, that would be a disaster for the United States      because it would set us back to January effectively.
75394|10|MADELEINE BRAND, host|So where is the US in all this?  Is it quietly behind the scenes      trying to pressure one side or the other to make concessions?
75394|11|Mr. DAN MURPHY (The Christian Science Monitor)|They're not so quietly behind the scenes.  Ambassador Zalmay      Khalilzad, who was in Afghanistan before and worked on the constitution      there, has been sitting--you know, he's probably spent 30 years sitting      down with these people in the past couple of days.  And he's in a very      interesting position.  On the one hand, the Bush administration, for      domestic political consumption, wants a fast deal as evidence of      progress, and that's why the keep emphasizing these deadlines.  And the      last deadline we wished last week was a sort of blow to the president.
70039|35|GLEN (Caller)|I think she described it very well. I really do.
70039|36|NEAL CONAN, host|All right, Glen.
70039|37|GLEN (Caller)|I hope you use a little better judgment next time. That's just my opinion.
70039|38|NEAL CONAN, host|OK, Glen, thanks very much.
70039|39|GLEN (Caller)|Thanks.
58225|16|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|I think this opinion was really about the health care mandate, which is coming up next. This is the first time in five years they've had a big case about the reach of federal power. Elena Kagan argued it, and everybody knew this case was  even though it was ostensibly about holding sex predators after their prison terms, the real dispute was the reach of federal power.
58225|17|NEAL CONAN, host|So it was a proxy.
58225|18|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Yes, and John Roberts actually joined this opinion. It was a five-to-four opinion basically saying that Congress can enact laws that are intended to  that are sort of necessary to carry out their aims.
58225|19|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|And if you think about the health care mandate debate, remember the argument is we need to mandate that all persons have health insurance. That's a necessary condition to regulate the national health insurance market.
58225|20|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Everybody agrees that Congress can regulate a market. The question was, can they also regulate sort of individuals and say, you must have insurance. And I would read this opinion today as basically five of them saying that Congress has very broad authority for things like this.
58225|21|NEAL CONAN, host|And those most opposed were Clarence Thomas and Mr. Scalia.
58225|22|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Yes, they have the sort of small-government, small-Constitution view. It's the kind of thing you hear the Tea Party people saying, you know, that the Constitution created a federal government with limited powers and only those limited powers. You know, you hear that all the time, and Scalia and Thomas basically said that, that Congress has certain limited powers, but we're not going to allow it just to willy-nilly to regulate aspects of American life.
58225|23|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|But as you said, this is a seven-to-two  only Scalia and Thomas voiced that view.
58225|24|NEAL CONAN, host|So if that seven-to-two majority is predictive, the health care law, well, it may not be that predictive, you never know.
58225|25|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|That's right, you never know. But I would sure think - there's a lot of language. When this case goes into court, and I think it's in the court in Florida already...
58225|26|NEAL CONAN, host|Yes.
58225|27|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|The Obama administration is going to cite this opinion and this language as saying, see, the Supreme Court just this year has said Congress has this broad authority to pass laws that are necessary for carrying out its purposes.
58225|28|NEAL CONAN, host|Now let's get on to the second case, and that involved minors who are sentenced to life without the possibility of parole in cases that do not involve homicides. And as I read the decision, this was sort of a follow-on to the ruling, what, just a year or so ago, that  some time ago  that minors could not be put to death because of psychological issues. Their brains are not fully developed.
58225|29|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Yes, that's right, Neal. It's very much the same thinking and very much the same justice. Justice Kennedy wrote both opinions, and in both cases, he stressed that teenagers, minors, are not fully formed. Yes, they can be punished, yes they can be dangerous people, but we should take into account their youth.
58225|30|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|And in the case of the juveniles who commit murder, Kennedy said its - they are not the worst of the worst and should not be sentenced to death. In this case, it involved life without parole for crimes that  it was like robbery or assault, that did not involve murder.
58225|31|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|I must say, this case came up last fall, and until it came up, I didn't know there was such a thing in the United States. There are 77 such inmates in Florida prisons, that is 15-, 16-, 17-year-olds that committed crimes like an assault or a robbery. A judge got really angry at them and said, look, you've been in here for a couple crimes before, I think you're hopeless. I'm going to sentence you to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
58225|32|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|The Supreme Court said today that's cruel and unusual punishment. It doesn't mean all these young men go free, it just means they're entitled to have a hearing somewhere down the road to see if they've been sufficiently rehabilitated that they can be released.
58225|33|NEAL CONAN, host|So they would have to go before a parole board, and they would have to approve the release.
58225|34|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|That's correct. All this says is that you can't shut the prison door forever and say, never again can you have a hearing. They're entitled to a parole hearing to say that theyre no longer dangerous.
58225|35|NEAL CONAN, host|Would they have to be resentenced?
58225|36|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|I assume that the state  I dont know for sure. I assume all the states are going to have to go back and impose some different sentence because the court was quite clear today in saying this sentence, this - categorically, you may not sentence someone to life in prison without parole if the person was under 18 at the time of the crime and if the crime did not involve a murder.
58225|37|NEAL CONAN, host|And what did  it was a five-to-four decision, so a close split. What did the minority say?
58225|38|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|The three dissenters  I should say, by the way, John Roberts agreed with the majority in part. He said this young man's sentence was grossly disproportionate, was unconstitutional. He just didn't like setting a categorical rule for all of them.
58225|39|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|The three dissenters basically said, as they've said before, is that this is up to the states and the people, juries and judges. Cruel and unusual punishment, we should interpret it by what it meant 200 years ago, and it's clear that states could punish people, even put people to death, for relatively minor crimes. And therefore, we shouldnt second-guess the state's decision to impose these prison terms.
58225|40|NEAL CONAN, host|Why should we nine justices in Washington think that we're better-suited to make these decisions than legislatures in Tallahassee or Sacramento, for that matter?
58225|42|NEAL CONAN, host|Okay. David Savage, this case, does it have broad implications like you suggest the first one did?
58225|43|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Well, I don't think it's easy to say. The court has been  you know, this is the first time in a big way that they have put a categorical limit on prison terms. In the past, the Eighth Amendment has always been about the death penalty. But if you said to me, what's next down the road? You know, I don't see another case comes along that Justice Kennedy could go along with.
58225|44|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|He didn't want to hand down this decision in a case involving a juvenile who committed a murder. It had appeals to that effect, and the court always turns them down. So they took a case that's involved life terms for juveniles where there's no murder involved. So I don't see it immediately translating into, you know, another group or another category of cases.
58225|45|NEAL CONAN, host|Well, David Savage, thanks very much for your time, as always.
58225|46|Mr. DAVID SAVAGE (Supreme Court Reporter, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune)|Thanks, Neal.
58225|47|NEAL CONAN, host|David Savage covers the Supreme Court for the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, joined us today by phone from his office there. In just a moment, we're going to be talking with advocates in both these cases, advocates who as it happens, both got the decisions they hoped to get, at least in part.
58225|48|NEAL CONAN, host|We'd like to hear from those of you who are affected by these cases one way or the other. Give us a call, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org.
58225|49|NEAL CONAN, host|We'll start here in Studio 3A with Marc Mauer, executive director of the Sentencing Project. They filed a brief in the case involving life sentences for juveniles with no chance of parole. The brief argued against those tough sentences for young offenders. Today, the court agreed. Marc Mauer with us. Thanks very much for your time.
58225|50|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|Good to be here.
58225|51|NEAL CONAN, host|And obviously you're happy with this decision.
58225|52|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|We are pleased. This is, you know, a very significant recognition that the so-called get-tough policies of the last several decades, they way they piled up both our criminal justice and juvenile justice systems, you know, have now gone well beyond what I think most Americans, you know, think is a reasonable way to respond to crimes committed by juveniles.
58225|53|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|And we should note these were serious crimes, even though they were non-homicides. The question still becomes, though, you know, are juveniles the same as adults? And I think the court has clearly said, no, they're not.
58225|54|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|And, you know, any parent who has a 13-year-old, you know, could answer that question, as well. You know, kids grow up. Kids change. This is a very (unintelligible)...
58225|55|NEAL CONAN, host|Impulse control is different. But nevertheless, individuals vary. Some of these kids may be fully formed.
58225|56|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|They certainly may be but, you know, that's the reason why we have restrictions on the right to vote at what age, what age you can drive a car, drink alcohol and all that. You know, there may be some 14-year-olds who can responsibly drink alcohol, but we're not really in a position to make that determination on a case-by-case basis, and so we have to set some sort of broad standard.
58225|57|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|And in this case, you know, when the consequences are so severe, in particular, the court has recognized that we need to set, you know, set that broad standard that says beyond this, below this, it's just not reasonable.
58225|58|NEAL CONAN, host|And so you have to come up with an arbitrary number, which in this case is 18.
58225|59|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|Yes, and, you know, I think it's important to note that, you know, the outlier position of the United States in regard to use of juvenile life without parole, you know, in addition to the kids who are affected by this ruling today, the others, you know, serving life without parole for homicides as well, more than 2,000 sentenced for crimes committed when theyre under the age of 18. If you look around the world, there is literally not a single other case that's been identified in any other country where any juvenile under 18 is serving such a sentence.
58225|60|NEAL CONAN, host|And only about 100 or so in this country, as I understand it.
58225|61|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|Hundred and twenty-nine for non-homicides and more for homicides.
58225|62|NEAL CONAN, host|And most of them, as we mentioned, in the state of Florida. Stay with us, if you would, Marc Mauer. We're also going to be joined by Stephen McAllister, solicitor general of Kansas, to talk about the other Supreme Court case today. And we'd like to hear your calls. If you're affected by either of these decisions, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. Stay with us. I'm Neal Conan. It's TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.
58225|63|_NO_SPEAKER|(Soundbite of music)
58225|64|NEAL CONAN, host|This is TALK OF THE NATION. Im Neal Conan in Washington.
58225|65|NEAL CONAN, host|Two decisions by the Supreme Court today changed the rules today on who can be held in prison and for how long, and raise new questions about who decides. Sex offenders deemed dangerous can be held indefinitely even after their sentence ends, while juveniles who didn't kill anyone cannot be sentence to life without possibility of parole. The court ruled they must be considered for release.
58225|66|NEAL CONAN, host|We'll talk with two people who filed briefs in those cases. If either of these cases affects you, give us a call, tell us how, 800-989-8255. Email us, talk@npr.org. You can also join the conversation on our website. Thats at npr.org. Click on TALK OF THE NATION.
58225|67|NEAL CONAN, host|Marc Mauer of The Sentencing Project, just to follow up on something we asked David Savage about a moment ago, will these  given this decision, will juveniles sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, will they have to be resentenced?
58225|68|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|Well, the court has basically said that every state that maintains some of these juveniles serving life without parole has to provide some kind of mechanism by which they can be considered for release at some point, to demonstrate they'd been rehabilitated, are good candidates for being released.
68175|55|Mr. ED CURRY (Farmer and Owner, Curry Seed and Chile Company, Pearce, Arizona)|Good question.  Good question, Ira.
58225|69|Mr. MARC MAUER (Executive Director, The Sentencing Project)|So that may vary from place to play and all that. And importantly, too, there are only 11 states plus the federal system where these even apply, where we actually have juveniles serving these penalties for non-homicides, which I think was part of the court's assessment, as well, declining support, declining interest in maintaining this penalty.
58225|70|NEAL CONAN, host|And let's bring on our other guest today. In the other notable high court ruling, U.S. v. Comstock, the Supreme Court ruled the federal government can hold convicts even after they serve their time if they are deemed sexually dangerous. Stephen McAllister, solicitor general of Kansas, he filed a brief arguing in favor of that federal law. He's been kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A. Thanks very much for your time today.
58225|71|Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)|My pleasure.
58225|72|NEAL CONAN, host|And you also are pleased with today's ruling.
58225|73|Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)|We're very pleased with the ruling, yes.
58225|74|NEAL CONAN, host|And how many people fall into this category?
58225|75|Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)|It's not a large number. The federal system is likely to be pretty selective. The programs are long-term, they're intensive. They're very costly. That's one of the reasons the states wrote in this case that we favored the federal program as a complement to our own.
58225|76|Mr. STEPHEN McALLISTER (Solicitor General, Kansas)|There are sort of inherent limits on how many individuals can be accommodated in these programs.
58225|77|NEAL CONAN, host|Who decides when someone is sexually dangerous and therefore cannot be released?
