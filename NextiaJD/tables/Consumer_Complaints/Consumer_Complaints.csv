10/17/2016|Consumer Loan|Vehicle loan|Managing the loan or lease||I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.||CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.|PA|177XX|Older American|Consent provided|Web|10/20/2016|Closed with explanation|Yes|No|2163100

We almost never carry a balance over, but we started to in XX/XX/XXXX and Barclay has been overcharging the interest expense every month. Instead of charging interest on the carried balance they charged it on the entire average balance. So if we charged {$3000.00} last month and carried {$3000.00} from previous months then they charged us 15 % of the {$6000.00} = {$75.00}, should have been {$37.00} in interest charges. They are double dipping, getting the interchange fee ( 1.5 % of purchase, equal to an 18 % apr ), plus they are getting the interest on the purchases at 15 %, that is the equivalent of an 33 % interest charge. 
I feel this practice is very unethical, if not illegal. We converted, not by our choice, from XXXX to Barclaycard MasterCard, so if we leave we lose all the points we acquired in previous years.

1 In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from the above company, The next day, I contacted their offices as instructed -- the memo dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX instruct me to contact the plaintiff attorney, not the court. I followed the instructions provided and contacted the plaintiff attorney by phone and also faxed a letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX disputing the debt ( see letter ). 

2. The company responded with a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by sending me a bill with a due date for XXXX. I had requested a bill showing what my balance was back when I made a payment back in XXXX XXXX for {$100.00}. I was disputing the amount owed, disputing the charges. 

3. I wrote back to the company and faxed another dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX continue to dispute the amount owed. 

4. The company sent me a response on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX saying that they furnished me the information, I was not disputing that I owe XXXX XXXX, I was disputing that the balance was inaccurate and that I needed proof of the last known charges and activity on the account which was XXXX XXXX. In the last paragraph of their letter it indicated that if I was disputing the amount to send a letter and so on.. 

5. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- I sent another letter to the company disputing the balance and requesting the documents again. 

The company never responded to my XXXX XXXX letter, they since had not communication with me, until XXXX XXXX XXXX when I received a letter from them with a copy of a DEFAULT judgment that they filed the court clerk 's office indicating that I failed to respond to their judgment. 

Facts:1. The only judgment that the above firm served me with was the original judgment which I am attaching dispute letters showing that I RESPONDED as instructed to their office on XXXX different occasions. 
2. The plaintiff failed to respond to my dispute and furnish the information provided-and was probably unable to obtain proof of the original of the debt3. Instead of using credible legal procedure to settle the debts, they utilized unfaithful and dirty tactics, violated my rights. 
4. Went to the court, committed perjury under the law by filing false documents with the court that I defaulted on the judgment and failed to respond when in fact I responded and they failed to furnish proof. 
5. I went the court house and the clerk 's office, I was told that the company did not notify their offices that they had been in contact with me, instead they the company told the court and clerk 's office that I did not respond to their summons the the clerks office granted them the default judgement based on their false information that I did not respond to their summons.

6/28/2016|Mortgage|FHA mortgage|Loan modification,collection,foreclosure||"I went through a divorce several years ago and requested a home loan modification through Bank of America. Bank of America refused to get back to me on several occasions causing the process to take a year, destroying my credit in the process. Only when they got the foreclosure judgment and sent it to sheriff sale did they process it correctly and I paid on time for over a year. We decided to sell the home in 2015 and listed it for sale. After about 75 days, we received an offer and accepted. We promptly got an apartment, paid a deposit and signed a lease. We moved into the new apartment about 5 days before closing. As we were preparing for closing, it was discovered by the purchasing lender ( unknown to me ) that Bank of America had sold our overdue principal to HUD. This required us to sell our home for over {$150000.00} to break even. The house only appraised at around {$120000.00} because there have been so many foreclosures in our area. I contacted Bank of America to determine what we could do and informed them that we had a buyer if they could process the short sale immediately. They said that they would probably not be able to and "" hopefully the buyer was still around ''. They went through the same process of continually requesting updated information for months while the process dragged on. I lost my buyer and could make the mortgage payments AND the rent payment on my apartment so I continued to work through the home modification process. I contacted their lawyers several times, received a response on a few occassions. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, I received an email back from XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX ( Bank of America 's attorney ) saying that my loan has been "" service released '' to XXXX XXXX. I immediately called them to restart the process and was sent out a packet. I was in the process of submitting the packet and gathering all of the info they needed. My wife drove by the house and there was a sherrif sale notification on it for XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America, who would no longer work with me and would never respond and sold it to XXXX, processed a sheriff sale. They began the sheriff sale process AFTER I was informed by their lawyers that they no longer serviced the loan! I called XXXX and they confirmed that Bank of America did complete that. 

Lastly, I logged on to the sheriff 's website to discover that BANK OF AMERICA bought it! 

I can only see this as they intentionally did this to somehow gain from the process."|Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response|BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION|OH|443XX||Consent provided|Web|6/28/2016|Closed with explanation|Yes|No|1987818

12/16/2016|Mortgage|Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM)|Loan servicing, payments, escrow account||"Select Portfolio Servicing has been deceptive and intimidating. It has been difficult for me to find my past due balance. I missed a regular monthly payment. When I attempted to make a payment to try to get caught up I could not find my past due balance. My printed statement listed a past due balance, but it did not list a payment that I had made prior to the statement being generated. My online account did not list a past due balance at all. It only told me that I had a regular monthly payment due. It also did not list any late fees or other fees of any kind. I then received a letter stating that my mortgage was now in default. This confused me even more because neither my statement or online account had any information about my loan being in default. Also, I did n't think my loan could be in default because I was approximately 30 days past due. I called SPS. When I called and entered in my account information, I was greeted by an audio recording stating that I had a regular monthly payment due. The recording made no reference to a past due balance or to my loan being in default or to any fees that may be due. I selected the option to speak with a representative. Prior to speaking with a representative I was greeted by another recording stating that I was about to speak with a "" debt collector '' and that any information given would be used in order to "" collect on a debt ''. At this point I felt SPS was deliberately trying to confuse and intimidate me. Is SPS a mortgage loan servicer or a debt collector? Is my account in default or past due? What is my past due balance? The rep I spoke with was polite, but not helpful. I did finally get my current past due balance. However, I was threatened with "" legal action '' if my account was not made current with in 6 days. I was not given an answer to why my online account does not reflect my past due balance, is my loan in default or past due, why do I have to pay {$15.00} to make an online payment, why did my interest rate go up. Furthermore, I was given unclear answers about what kind of a company SPS is ( mortgage loan servicer or debt collector ), why do they use intimidating language both in documents and over the phone, is SPS purposefully trying to confuse me. I acknowledge that I am past due on my payments, but it should not be this difficult to find my past due balance and I should not be threatened and intimidated."|Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law|SELECT PORTFOLIO SERVICING, INC.|FL|338XX||Consent provided|Web|12/16/2016|Closed with explanation|Yes|Yes|2253533

On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new account at US Bank ( XXXX XXXX ).

The Bank has failed to provide satisfactorily explanation of this change in policy. At the time of opening the new account, I was not given any notice or warning that new rules would apply. The Bank keeps adding extended overdraft fees. 
In my perception, the bank should have not honored any payments that were underfunded nor charged any fees for overdraft nor returned items because US Bank created a reasonable expectation through consistent behavior upon which reliance was reasonable.

1/10/2017|Student loan|Federal student loan servicing|Can't repay my loan|Can't get flexible payment options|"I was dropped from my income based repayment plan by FedLoan servicing in XXXX of 2016. they contacted me by email but never tried to call me, even after being delinquent for over 2 months, ( while they had my current phone number on file ). When I checked my loans myself, I found statements saying I needed to pay over XXXX dollars of standard repayments that had accrued in order to remove the delinquency ( i believe this is predatory and illegal ). Instead I contacted an Ombudsman from the XXXX. She instructed me to declare forbearance ( which Fedloan services did not tell me was an option. FedLoan services told me I had to pay the full 2 months payments on a standard repayment plan I was now on, and continue to pay that amount until a new IBR payment plan was processed. this sounded fraudulent so I contacted a XXXX ombudsman. 

After the Ombudsman talked with the student loan company, both parties ( lender and ombudsman ) told me on XXXX XXXX that I would be entered into forbearance and a new loan document asking me to pay a nominal {$5.00} fee would be sent to me. After this fee is payed, I was told I would enter my repayment plan. I was assured my application was in their system and being processed, and Fedloan services person even confirmed they had my income verification documents showing I made around {$16000.00}, and would pay XXXX on an IBR plan. All I had to do was pay a {$5.00} fee to place the loan back on the payment plan. They said I should allow 3 weeks for them to "" process '' my plan, even though they literally had every piece of information in front of them. 

On XXXX XXXX I received a letter informing me they were missing documentation of my income, which makes no sense, because the woman over the phone was able to tell me my income 4 days earlier. when I called Fedloan services they tell me I need to fill out a paper application for the IBR plan, and submit paper copies of my income verification which directly contradicts everything they told the ombudsman, and everything it says on both their website and XXXX. why do they even have an app with income verification tools if you need to send a paper application as well? 

I believe this company removed me from my plan in the first place in order to threaten me with fraudulent back payments. since early XXXX I have been trying to have my IBR plan processed, which is supposed to take less than 2 weeks and it is taking over 2 months. I have had to reapply for the IBR XXXX separate times now in 2 months, and have gone onto forbearence twice and Fedloan services has instructed me at every turn to fill out another form or send something in, or wait 3 weeks for somethings to be processed. 

This entire time I have been living on an income of less than {$900.00} per month, working part time, and I can prove all of this. So I am well below the threshold for an IBR plan, and they even told me over the phone that I was eligible for {$0.00} payments. there is no excuse for them to be dragging their feet except to force me out of the IBR plan and into a plan where they can collect more money for not processing my information. 

I am still actively trying to pursue this matter with the ombudsman and Fedloan services, but I want to enter a formal complaint with the CFPB, as the behavior of my loan servicer has been dishonest and ( purposely! ) confusing, slow and incompetent to throw people like me into default so they can make more money off of fees."||AES/PHEAA|MI|488XX||Consent provided|Web|1/10/2017|Closed with explanation|Yes|Yes|2283195
6/1/2016|Bank account or service|Other bank product/service|Making/receiving payments, sending money||"This complaint is regarding Wells Fargo. XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my home mortgage taking cash out to make home repairs, pay off an auto loan and pay off an installment loan with Wells Fargo. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I made the final payment on the installment loan at a local Wells Fargo branch. This check included a slight overpayment. The payment on the loan, final accrued interest and overpayment were all processed on XXXX/XXXX/16. On XXXX/XXXX/16 Wells Fargo reversed the entire amount paid on XXXX/XXXX/16 telling me the loan payoff was coded incorrectly. The representative on the phone told me on XXXX/XXXX/16 the loan payment was being reprocessed and should be back dated to the actual payment date. In the meantime, Wells Fargo is telling me the same installment loan is past due and put a {$39.00} late charge on the account. On XXXX/XXXX/16 I called customer service to find out why the reprocessing of the loan payoff still had not gone through. I was told it was still in process. On Saturday, XXXX/XXXX/16 I went to the local branch where the original payment was made back on XXXX/XXXX/16. The personal banker called on this same installment loan and was told the payment was not made correctly. And that Wells Fargo is reprocessing the payment. This personal banker in the branch said everything was applied correctly on her end, so she felt this should be resolved and soon. Today, XXXX/XXXX/16 I contacted Wells Fargo customer service via phone again and was informed the bank check from the title company was returned for insufficient funds twice. We contacted the title company who confirmed verbally the check for the loan cleared their bank on XXXX/XXXX/16. Account numbers and check numbers were confirmed. Payments were due on this installment loan on the XXXX of each month. The loan is now XXXX days past due according to Wells Fargo. Yet I have a receipt with a transaction number proving I paid the loan IN FULL on XXXX/XXXX/16. This loan pay off was rolled into my current mortgage with Wells Fargo. So I feel they are trying to collect on the same debt twice and/or lost {$6800.00}! I keep getting told by Wells Fargo "" we need to research this '' but no one can seem to get this resolved."|Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response|WELLS FARGO & COMPANY|NV|891XX||Consent provided|Web|6/1/2016|Closed with monetary relief|Yes|No|1949163
