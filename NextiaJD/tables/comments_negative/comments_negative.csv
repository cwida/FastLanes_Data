I just hate islam and everything it stands for. 

I don't want to share my streets, schools, stores, or any place else that I frequent, with muslims. They are beneath me and don't deserve to inhabit my country. 

I am sick of ""diversity"" and the poverty, crime, and lower standard of living that comes along with it. 

I am sick of leftist morons that keep trying to shove it down our throats yet it is painfully obvious to everyone these people do not belong in a civilized society. 

Do you think it's a coincidence the places they hail from are complete cesspools? It is because their culture is inferior to ours. 

They run from the mess they have created of their own homeland and instead of realizing their culture is inferior, they attempt to import their failed way of life into my country. 

They are slowly but surely destroying this country. It's spreading like cancer, look at California's problems which are a direct result of illegal Mexicans pouring across the boarder importing crime, disease, and poverty.

Fuck islam, diversity, and the inferior cultures our politically correct and worthless politicians continue to push on everyone.

I went to a high school in LA and you *(allegedly)* crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton).  You *(allegedly)* ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanne.  You (allegedly) didn't call her afterwards.  She *(allegedly)* cried a lot.  Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you *(allegedly)* been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip?

/I'm *(allegedly)* not kidding.  

**Edit**: Umm, is it cool if I find it kind of hilarious that this is the top comment? Whenever I see him interviewed (like on Letterman a couple of nights ago) I always think back on this and just shake my head.  Sorry Woody....but whatever, he has a pretty notorious reputation for being a pussy hound.  And its not like I asked President Obama or UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon if they boned a high school graduate....he's just a Hollywood actor and this *is* an AMA.  So yeah.  (and I highly doubt he's answering in any case except for maybe 4 words; ""No, it never happened."")  And I wholeheartedly agree with this [sentiment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3njs26)

To answer some questions - yes she was pretty attractive (and no I'm not Roseanne you witty motherfuckers, nor was I her date).  The weird thing is that she was a pretty serious girl not known as a partier and had a lot of guys after her.  Pretty shy and quiet, which is why afterwards I was like, what the fuck?  *Her*? (also not giving year because I just know some of you internet detectives will track the poor girl down.  If he can't remember this event given the circumstances, name and hotel...well he really has gotten laid too much in his life).

Also some of the pearl clutching over the question is highly amusing.

c0lab7u|t1_c0la9si|t5_6|t3_b72yd|"I upvoted you, but I think it's important to note that Reddit is a site that explicitly invites self-promotion when it's conducted in an appropriate manner. I personally don't find most of The Oatmeal's comics very funny (though the one about why he hates talking on the phone made me chuckle) but he's a friendly fellow who is nothing if not honest about that he's promoting his own sites and making money. He's also a decent cartoonist and seems to be a hard worker.

In short, if he's ""gaming the system"" by creating original content that people like and presenting it in an attractive manner that's not full of gratuitous ugly ads, more power to him. I'd rather have 100 like him on Reddit than the people who start a blog and post one stolen image at a time with five or six Google ads per page and then spam it to r/pics."|-1845|-1845|Saydrah|0|t3_b72yd|"He is a former SEOmoz guy, he knows his way around to game the system and draw traffic. I have seen some of his work during his time with Seomoz and also after he left them. I think he also designed the original Seomoz site (which was nicer than the current one). He also made a dating site (I think in one week) called mingle2 which he later sold it.

When he started making these comics, each comic had their own unique domain name and he would get them on the digg frontpage. Usually after digg frontpage the traffic was still coming in so he would link them to mingle2 website to drive traffic there. I think I have seen him link to other sites too, possibly his other clients (including an insurance company, but I could be wrong, that was more than a year ago).

The reason I am telling you this, because I think its important to put things in to perspective. He is an SEO guy, he has been around for some time and he knows how to ""game"" the system.

It doesn't take away the fact that some of his work is genuinely very good and funny and I have personally enjoyed them.

**Edit:** *Some notes I could find after short googling*

- His blog post on Mingle2 work done in 66.5 hours: http://mingle2.com/blog/view/how-i-built-mingle2
- Mingle2 domain submission by him and ""Oat"" (his other nick): http://www.reddit.com/domain/mingle2.com
- His last blog post on Seomoz, while still working: http://www.seomoz.org/blog/my-departure-from-seomoz 
- He made another blog post on Seomoz after leaving: http://www.seomoz.org/blog/widgetbait-gone-wild, where discusses how he gets traffic from sites through widget. This are all the widgets [he created](http://www.oneplusyou.com/q) while working for his new job. If you closely look at those widgets you will see that some (but not all) of those ideas has been rehashed in to ""oatmeal""
- If you have time you can read through his Comments and see how he drives traffic to his work: http://www.seomoz.org/blog/author/30 (hopefully someone doesn't delete them)

This guy is much much better than I will ever be. But its good to have some perspective and knowledge. He knows the system inside out, while you guys are being amazed by raptors he is doing his thing.

I am writing this from my disposable account, because I seriously fear this guy and I think he can do some harm to me if I post from my regular account. Because I use the same name for my other online identities.

By the way, Congratulations on the book deal. I actually bought your self-published comic last year.

**Edit2**: I am proud of myself knowing that I have such good memories. Remember the insurance company I mentioned earlier?
Here is the [digg submission](http://digg.com/odd_stuff/Top_10_most_stolen_cars_in_the_US) by him to StateFarm Insurance website from 2007. [More Gems](http://digg.com/users/Oatmeal/history/submissions/page12), if you have the patience to digg around.

Last word before I am done with this comment. Please do take me seriously when I say this, *Reddit is as much prone to ""gaming"" as digg*. It might not be as easy, but it is most definitely possible. You really think when there is $100,000s potentially on the line **in the future** to get something viral someone won't invest on few dozen machines (renting unique ips is literally peanut money) with unique ips to get their story/business/blog/ in to more eyes? It happens _all_ the time, now they are just good at it.

We like to believe that Reddit is not prone to gaming, because we _love_ reddit. It can't possibly happen. If you have some background on how SEO viral marketing works, you would also think like me and be skeptical about certain things.

Food for thought.

Wow... okay, I wasn't sure if I was ever going to tell anyone about this, but it's late and I'm sleep deprived so i guess I'll just write it now and regret it in the morning :/

First of all, - just for some background:   My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.)  I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born.  So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.

Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister.  When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.  

I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself.   I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice.  I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home.  (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).

Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point.  She was also having bad trouble with the law.  She was actually in custody when I left home.

My friend and I went to go pick her up.  When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out.  Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too.  She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know?  I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.

After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends.  On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous.  He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition.  Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.

Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot.  I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.

My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them.  It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident.  It was fucked up. I almost died.   But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.  

Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it.  We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way.   It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her.  But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down,  we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings.  *Sigh*.

A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy).  I can't say I was surprised.

But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone.  It was a really intimate moment.  I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him.

My dog is a kid magnet, he's a purebred dalmatian. He unfortunately was getting over an ear infection at this particular time and the kid decided that he'd just pull the shit out of them even after my warning him not to touch his ears. So I have a go at the parent and she said if my dog bit her kid, IN THE DOG PARK, that she'd have him put down. Three other people heard me tell the fucking kid not to touching his damn ears... Don't bring your kid into my dog's playground then tell me you'll have my dog put down if he nips your kid... Some fucking people...

Edit: Apparently people are misreading this. He didn't bite or nip the kid. The mother was the one who made the implication that he would. And he was over the infection, not over the ear tenderness. I had taken him to the vet to have him cleared to get to go to the park again not two days prior to this.

You're connecting quite a few dots there that are relatively unconnected. I found the free page of keys, saved a copy because fuck i've been on the internet long enough to know what was going to happen, and then well, someone deleted the fuckers.

I then angrily posted on /r/gaming

http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wtot9/well_thanks_reddit_youve_just_wiped_a_list_of/

and in SPITE i linked you all keys, never claiming i owned them or they were mine. Most of this stuff is in the original thread, but like i said, everything important gets downvoted."|-803|-803|[deleted]|0|t3_x0uqn|"**Summary**


~~[Kama_Blue](http://www.reddit.com/user/Kama_Blue/) posted a thread in /r/gaming with a Google Doc filled with Steam keys for users to get. [He stated that there were over 5000 keys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wtot9/well_thanks_reddit_youve_just_wiped_a_list_of/)~~
As Kama_Blue stated [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0uqn/this_is_not_okay/c5ibzg4), he only posted the full doc after he finished giving out keys.


He then posted another thread with a picture showing [all the keys wiped from the Google Doc](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wtot9/well_thanks_reddit_youve_just_wiped_a_list_of/), and said he will be posting keys one by one through comments.

He then posted another thread [with a screenshot of multiple people asking for Skyrim/ARMA II keys](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0a6b/after_passing_out_1000s_of_steam_keys_on_rgaming/), saying that most people don't read and that they didn't check which keys were available.

Now [Tvacgamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/tvacgamer) is saying that he is a [Marketing Manager at Amazon Game Downloads](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0a6b/after_passing_out_1000s_of_steam_keys_on_rgaming/c5i3zbv) and some of the keys originally posted match up with the original source files. [Users](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0uqn/this_is_not_okay/c5i6en5) have confirmed that he is who he says he is. Tvacgamer isn't accusing Karma_Blue of stealing the keys, but he is saying that thats where those keys came from.

~~I have not found the original thread with the Google Doc~~ As [Jetmaster](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0uqn/this_is_not_okay/c5i6y4a) pointed out, [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0Amf6aEJYxwQmdHE0VWU1cmhoYWh3Z2Nxbk9IY1NHTGc&amp;toomany=true#gid=2) is the original Google Docs Spreadsheet.

~~As [deleted] posted here, it looks like Kama_Blue used another account to post the original Google Docs thread, as stated here.~~ Not his alternate.

Hope this clears things up. If I missed anything feel free to comment and I'll edit it as needed. Also, be careful about raising a mob about this. Let the mods handle it and then let it die down. Just my 2 cents.

EDIT: I am [Kama_Blue](http://i.imgur.com/RUbZn.gif).  


EDIT: Kidding. If you laughed you can't call me a bad person.

Kama_Blue has now replied [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0uqn/this_is_not_okay/c5i8gul). If you do not agree with him, fine, but I don't think you should downvote that comment when he is just telling his side of the story.

Kama_Blue has also stated [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/x0a6b/after_passing_out_1000s_of_steam_keys_on_rgaming/c5i85d0) that the keys were floating around /v/ (board on 4chan for gaming) and he knew they would most likely be deleted soon, so he saved as much he could. He regrets not originally posting the exactly where the keys came from, but ""free keys are free keys"".

a truly strong intelligent and independent woman will have a man contribute to raising the child. has a man that respects her and understands that having the child and birthing the child and nursing the child will completely interfere in her ability to work for money, and be a healthy and good mother. he will therefore be glad in paying more than his 50% and in fact 100% if he wishes to see his children healthy.
unless you expect her to dole out another mortgage payment for daycare in which she will lose most if not all of her income unless you live in france.. 
you still will pay money, honey, because the world is not anywhere near that point. and it is unfair to force women to be the one to take the burden. 
stop wanting your cake and eat to too."|-616|-616|EyesfurtherUp|0|t3_zicl0|"So, because you are capable of having children, I'm expected to pay for everything on the IDEA that I MAY have a child with you? Sorry, but until you actually ARE dealing with a child and such, a woman will not be 'strong and independent' if she is practically mooching off a man. Once she IS giving up the resources for the child, THEN the man can start doing the paying. 

I'll admit, you are right about the physical resources expended on a child, but it's not like the man is the only one deciding this. Both the woman and man MUST consent, so the woman CHOOSES to give up those resources. Also, its not like every woman who has a kid is a stay-at-home mom, so its not like the man has to pay for everything since she is doing all the work at home. If this were the case, then it would make sense for the man to do all the paying, because now its an even deal. If both parents are working, then they must SHARE the costs and profits, depending on the situation, income, etc. 
Since when was a woman who sits back at home, has the kids and takes care of them while a man does all the paying 'strong and independent' anyway? Isn't that what caused feminist movement in the first place, where women are forced to take care of the kids all by themselves while the man takes all the income? Wasn't the idea of a strong, independent woman one where she and her partner have equal respect for another, both contribute income to the family, while both take the duty of raising the kid? 

If you think that being able to have a kid means that you require someone to pay for everything for you, then you are pushing back the feminist movement.


**TL;DR: A truly strong and independent woman/man contributes to the family, respects their spouse (if they have one) and shares the duty of raising a kid (if they have one). Anyone who says a man must pay for all a woman's things because she's the childbearer is cancerous to feminism and trying to have their cake and eat it.**"|236|236|Kaminohanshin|0

Goats can't consent.  Also, the definition of gay does not include beastiality.  However the definition of insane has this guy's picture beside it.

I see no reason to apologize for pointing out that there isn't much attraction to mingling with yet more sexually frustrated males with large amounts of alcohol involved - this is not my idea of a good time.

c4zp0vw|t1_c4zh8qr|t5_2qh33|t3_uxee8|"There are a lot of interesting things about the phenomenon you are witnessing. First we can see that plenty of people who have a lot of positive comment karma, don't really care about it all that much, which runs contrary to what redditors tend to believe about other redditors.

Secondly, you see the herd mentality at work. I too, was engaged with the idea of very simply and efficiently downvoting comments by pressing ""z"". The fact one does not even have to open the comment, if it falls below the threshold you have set for your account is quite interesting. 

Also, it would seem that perhaps, there are a few commentors who do care about their comment karma, as evidenced by the deleted posts, but also a few that care about their karma score, but also have an intense martyr complex.

Many of the comments are simply deserving of normal downvotes, because they have nothing to actually add to the conversation, so reddiquette would dictate a number of downvotes, a priori. Those comments might not be the best examples of the current state of affairs, but rather can serve as control elements.

I am sure there are many more interesting things to point out, but I will leave that to you, dear, brave reader. "|-583|-583|mrimperfect|0|t3_uxee8|My God.... they're all.... dead....|-1622|-1622|Shut_Up_Dude|0

George Costanza wakes up in a a completely white area. The only object he can find is his bed. He travels for hundreds of yards in every direction, and hits no wall or boundary. The farther he travels, the bigger his bed becomes.

**Tuesday the 2nd, May 2032, 14:32**

A mindless voice announces to George that the movie is about to began. 

**Tuesday the 2nd, May 2032, 18:12**

Movie has not yet started. George sits on his bed.

**Wednesday the 3rd, May 2032, 2:14**

The movie begins, and wakes George from sleep. The movie is shown on a screen that appears to be gigantic, but as George approaches it the screen becomes smaller, until he can no longer see it. The movie is of a masked, elderly man pushing a large box down a flight of stairs, on repeat. Each time the box falls down the stairs, it emits an unsettling, unnatural scream.

**Wednesday the 3rd, May 2032, 15:52**

The movie stops repeating.

**Wednesday the 3rd, May 2032, 17:42**

Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer are wondering the streets of New York, looking for George, who hasn’t been heard from for about a day now.

**Thursday the 4th, May 2032, 7:43**

George peacefully awakes from slumber, and is greeted by Jim Morrison standing at the foot of his bed.

**Thursday the 4th, May 2032, 19:10**

Jim Morrison has stood at the end of the bed silently for the whole day. George walks 1,203 yards north of the bed and hits an invisible boundary. From here, the bed appears to be at least seven miles high.

**Thursday the 4th, May 2032, 23:04**

George arrives at his bed again. A train, drives up to the bed. Jim Morrison proclaims to George that the train is “16 countries long.”
Morrison steps into the train, and it begins to leave.

**Friday the 6th, May 2032, 16:51**

The end of the train finally passes by George’s bed. 

**Tuesday the 10th, May 2032, 13:46**

George notices a small, blue ball on the floor next to his bed.

**Wednesday the 11th, May 2032, 17:32**

Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer are walking down an alley behind Monk’s Cafe. The group sees a body in a dumpster, and upon closer inspection, the body is determined to be that of George’s, with a gunshot wound to the forehead. 

**Friday the 13th, May 2032, 12:34**

The Coroner determines that George Costanza has been dead for 17 years.
