37|cfarrell|10.0|THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.|13|Catan

41|andy hart|10.0|So, it's a ten then. I hate to have to go with the crowd, but after several years playing, it's still one of the first games to come out during a session. Yes, there's a certain ammount of luck (I once won a game becuase the dice simply WOULD NOT stop coming up 4's. Guess who had 4) but it's usually up to the individual players as to what use they make out of their resources. An real winner. |13|Catan

72|krystrandya|10.0|I am so glad this game exists.  Fun.  It's for the random folks who game.  Playable with folks who want to be gamers, but really like a bit more light fare.  The dice are the deciding factor.  I sware.. put everything on 9, it's better than 6/8 in our games :).  It reminds me of gambling a lot.  Hard if there is someone who gets seriously.. painfully beaten each time because the dot discussion on probabilities is a bit too much for them.  So.. in a certain group, it's great.

My favorite Settlers story comes from my friend Andy, who played a game in which all his opponents were extremely agreeable when it came to trading (""anyone trade me a sheep and a wood for a wood?  I need a sheep?""  ""Sure!"")  He was way too smart to do this.  Halfway through the game he realized he was hopelessly behind...  We always call this game ""Settlers"", but you can't find it using the Search function on BGG if you type in ""Settlers"".  It's stupid."|13|Catan

184|Gordon the Green|10.0|The Settlers of Catan may well be the single greatest board game ever designed. Like many other German games, it combines simple rules and a short playing time with the potential for intricate strategy and battles of wits. But Catan is arguably the best example of bringing all these elements into perfect balance.  Catan satisfies a wide range of people, even those who normally hate board games, since it is the players themselves that choose the character of each game. It can be as cutthroat or as amiable as you want (or both!). It also excels at keeping every player actively involved at all times, both through the ingenious system of resource production and the constant opportunities for trading and deal-making. I could go on, but others already have.  I have no hesitation in recommending Settlers of Catan to pretty much anyone. From there, you may choose to explore more complex or more simple-structure games, but Catan is good for all! |13|Catan

208|andrewh63|10.0|Such a simple game but yet you have so many decisions.  I played this with my friend Lyman and immediately saw the potential for a great game.  I brought one copy to the gaming group and started the whole trend.  I ended up contacting a German MTG player who arranged to shipped about a dozen copies of the game plus the 5-6 expansion kit to our group.  This was before German game was avail in the US.

I never knew games like Settlers existed until GenCon in 1997.  I played it a ton (many, many times before I started logging plays on BGG), and taught it to so many friends that I got sick of teaching the rules.  Even though it rarely sees the table these days, I still put it in my own personal Hall of Fame, and therefore rate it a 10."|13|Catan

I'm glad to see that it is finally catching on to the mainstream gaming community!  Bit too much luck is involved with the dice rolls at times, but the game is well balanced over time.  Loved by my guy friends and gal friends, gamers and non-gamers alike.  Scoring is simple, and almost every game everyone gets the feeling that they are somewhat close to winning.  Perhaps not the best game ever made in the modern time, but definitely the first of the best that opened the door for many more to come -- for that, it deserves a 10!|13|Catan

A game where luck is a virtue, forcing trading, attention to hand-limits and use (& defence against) the blocking robber.  A gateway game that’s a wonderful destination in its own right.  While the basic game is a 10, almost every expansion adds complexity or downtime, and reduces the rating.|13|Catan

425|djflippy|10.0|"Settlers is an absolute classic. It is one of my personal favorites and it is the ""gateway game"" that allowed me to bring countless new players into gaming. It is the quintessential resource management game. It uses a tile-laying mechanism similar to that of [gameid=58], which ensures a different board layout every game. Players then populate this map with settlements to obtain resources like wood and stone that can be used to build more structures and roads. There are several routes to victory and discovering different strategies and other subtleties of play ensures a high replayability factor. Most importantly, it gives players the opportunity to ask the age-old question, ""Do you have wood for sheep?"""|13|Catan

439|Outside Lime|10.0|The introductory Euro-game for me and the one which has achieved the best penetration amongst my non-gaming friends. Evidence: We hosted a Settlers tourney at our house with 24 players, and none of those people with the exception of myself owns a game invented since 1980.  Settlers has many attractive elements to it. The easy lingo, the constant engagement created by the resource-generation system, and the cute little network that you build are some standout features that are very appreciated by new players.  |13|Catan

Players are settling the world of Catan by trading resources and building settlements, cities and roads to be the first player to achieve the number of points needed to win the game. Easy, elegant, quick to pick up and explain and, of course, fun to play!  Trading and strategically placing key roads and buildings are well balanced. A must for any game household!|13|Catan

468|Shaun L|10.0|The modular board and trading are fantastic mechanics for replayability and player interaction. Settlers provides a nice balance between long-term planning and randomness. Its always a thrill to have your cities start producing after clawing your way forward in the early game.   I've always preferred vanilla Settlers to the expansions. For a so-called gateway game Settlers has a LOT of rules. Adding in expansions doesn't seem like a productive way to recruit new board game enthusiasts. Why complicate a fantastic game when you can pull out any number of other games that will introduce new mechanics?  ASIDE: I also have the Korean version (카탄), which is basically the Kosmos version.

I will say, however, that comments that this game is random reek of more ignorance than just about any other stereotypical BGG comment.

Even 15 years on there are still no better games out there. Why?  First would be that every game is different, right from the start.  The modular board presents the players with a significantly different challenge each time - not many games do that.  Second, there is very little downtime.

634|gamesgrandpa|10.0|[Original comment] This is currently the favorite game in our family (April 2005). It has most of the features we enjoy about gaming. There is a lot of interaction and negotiation with other players; the gameboard is different every time; there are enough important factors to consider that no single strategy will win every time; there is just enough randomness to make it interesting (and sometimes frustrating); the rules are not complicated; the game time is just right (we can now play a 5-player game in about an hour); and players have a number of options almost every turn, to require some decision-making. It's an excellent family game.  Update February 2006 -- We usually play with 6 players now, and it is still a family favorite.  (December 2006) And now, we're playing with 7 players, and it's still a favorite, although we've had to modify some rules to play with that many.  May 2009 -- This is still a family favorite, and we play it often.  October 2011 -- This long-time family favorite continues to be at or near the top of our selection lists for game days. We always play with at least 5 players, which makes for a crowded map. The negotiations, blocking, the moans over the dice rolls, and the surprises (like stealing the Longest Road to win the game) keep it high on our list of favorites. I doubt we will ever tire of this game, which is about as high a compliment as can be made.  November 2012 -- We may play this game forever. Our daughter and son-in-law purchased the fancy version with wood tiles, which makes the game much more attractive. It continues to be a family favorite.  2013-November:  We haven't changed our minds about this game -- it's still a family favorite.|13|Catan

682|rajungamer|10.0|A great game. Simple to play, has a good balance of luck verses strategy. I Like how you are encouraged to trade to get ahead. The hand size limits imposed by the robber keeps you from hoarding. It is easy to fall behind the development curve, but you can restrain a runaway leader by not trading. Anyway if some of the charity variants can level out the bad die rolls. A good family game.  On of the best games I played was a 4 player settlers - on player announced that he was building a settlement for the win only to find out he didn't have one more. The look on his face was priceless|13|Catan

712|JMcL63|10.0|This game deserves an emphatic 10 because it is a landmark in the development of modern boardgaming. It showed that the best rules-mechanical insights of wargames could be brought to bear to other kinds of boardgames to improve their designs too. Today's games are more interesting and challenging than all but a few favourites from my childhood.  Klaus Teuber didn't do this single-handed, but Settlers was a big contribution. It's great fun to play, and will long continue to win many new fans.|13|Catan

746|crackedlcd81|10.0|"F&%k all the elitist, snotnose backlash this game gets from people who think they've ""moved on"" to supposedly superior fare like PUERTO RICO- SETTLERS is the definitive Eurogame and the absolute best in its class, a truly transcendant title that encompasses the best that gaming has to offer.  Direct and meaningful player interaction, luck and strategy, long term planning and situational flexibility, competition, and a sense of narrative development serve to ensure that SETTLERS will long outlive the 5000 or so inferior European designs that have followed in its wake.  This is truly one of the watershed titles in the hobby on par with DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS and MAGIC: THE GATHERING in terms of industry impact, accessibility, and paradigm shifting.  It saddens me to see folks say how they've somehow burned out on SETTLERS when this is one of the rare games that has virtually unlimited replayability and is almost always a unique and fun experience.  You don't like the dice?  Go do Sudoku puzzles and cram your statistics textbook up your ass.  The dice make the game dramatic, variable, and it forces players to adapt and adjust throughout the game.  With trading, you are _never_ screwed unless you're one of those shrewish gamers who's afraid to speak up at the table to get what you want.  Without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever published and a timeless classic."|13|Catan

850|acetate3|10.0|A guy I knew from GW gaming showed us Settlers... I loved it. Later on in college, a friend showed me the copy he picked up during a visit to Germany. The rest is history! I absolutely love this game. My personal favorite of the millenium. I have introduced countless people to Euros through this game, and only a handfull have not enjoyed themselves. When I think about Eurogames, I think about Settlers of Catan.UPDATE: I finally have grown a little weary of Settlers. It is an amazing game, for sure, but I realize that there are many more games out there to be discovered. I'll still play it gladly if requested, but will probably push for Cities and Knights over the basic game. I do, however, give in to the fact that Settlers is the biggest deal as far as my board gaming history goes, and for that reason it now gets a 10, even though I'm a lot less likely to play it.|13|Catan

881|A Strange Aeon|10.0|If I'm going to play a Euro, it should be exciting, and Settlers is certainly that.  The dice rolls really make the game--they let the drama of not getting what you need, of being forced to make new plans, rise up.  My only complaint is that you can be out of the game before your first turn if your initial set up isn't well thought out.  That is a huge barrier for new players versus experienced players, but the game seems to have done alright for itself.  Certainly worthy of its status, and I don't understand why it isn't ranked higher.  |13|Catan

1027|Checkallday|10.0|"A classic that should be in the top ten. Many NEWNEWNEWBUYBUYBUYERS find this game 'dated', which is absurd really. Dated in what sense? How? Not only do I owe Settlers my entire existence as a game hobbyist, but it is a fantastic game that manages to appeal to both the strategic gamer and those who have only played mainstream games. As the groupthink wheel slowly turns and the NEWNEWNEWERS get sick of the 10-mechanics-and-a-pasted-theme Euros, when the simple, elegant loveliness of the classic Euros comes back in fashion, Settlers will return, slaughter the suitors and reclaim its crown.   I love the dice. They add a tension and risk management to what might otherwise have been a dull resource conversion game (as if we need another one of those).   COPY AND PASTE FROM MY GEEKLIST RANT:  Settlers of Catan's slide towards the bottom of the top 100 is proof again of the silliness of BGG's ratings system and its bias in favor of new-and-shiny games over the classics. Like Monopoly (which is also much better than BGG gives it credit for), Chess, and dozens of other older games, Settlers of Catan's popularity, age, and ubiquity work against it having a higher rating, but it is still one of the best introductory games and one of my favorite Eurogames.   The saturated, consumerist board game market, with dozens of new releases every week, encourages players to shallowly rate games after one or two plays--which makes no sense since it often takes several plays to internalize the rules for even a simple game to the point where a player can focus on actually playing the game well. Market saturation encourages us to ""take his word for it"" and rate with the group (many members of which will be doing the same thing) so we that can unwrap the next package.   Coupled with the saturated market is BGG's stranglehold on board game culture. The dominance of one information-outlet is not conducive to a free thinking environment, even in the case of user-generated content websites like BGG. A glimpse through the comments section for any top-100 game shows that raters are often repeating or paraphrasing the comments and judgements of other raters. Absolute democracy, which under-informed (because few of us have time enough to play any but our favorite games more than once or twice), user-generated content websites often resemble, encourages groupthink and the tyranny of the single persuasive voice. The practice that a few well known ""game critics"" have of passing judgement or rating games after a single play is intellectually dishonest and ethically suspect.   Don't get me wrong, I love BGG and spend too much time here looking for new games, but the ratings system has never been much use to me beyond providing a starting point for game research. Giving anything but the most minor significance to which game lies where on the scale is the equivalent of basing judgements of worth and value on the results of a popularity contest.   A thousand unwise voices rolled into one do not necessarily become one wise voice. It's too bad that Settlers may not show up on the first page of the top 100; it is a fantastic game, and one that I will play any time and anywhere.   "|13|Catan

1079|iansc|10.0|The very essense of what makes a game elegant: simple rules, fun to play and there's nothing in the game that doesn't have a place or that shouldn't be there. OK, it's a probability-based game, so you can play optimally and still lose, while the random setup occasionally produces a board so imbalanced that the start player effectively wins by placing his first settlement. Overall though, a superlative game with bags of appeal to both gamers and families alike that would have entirely eclipsed Monopoly by now, if only Settlers were better known. This is the gateway game that I turn to whenever I'm playing with casually interested 'non gamers'. It's never missed yet.|13|Catan

I find it amazing that the dice rolling alone turns some people off.  Here's a nice quip about the game:  ""You don't like the dice? Go do Sudoku puzzles and cram your statistics textbook up your ass. The dice make the game dramatic, variable, and it forces players to adapt and adjust throughout the game. With trading, you are _never_ screwed unless you're one of those shrewish gamers who's afraid to speak up at the table to get what you want. Without a doubt, one of the greatest games ever published and a timeless classic."" -- crackedlcd81"|13|Catan

I dont know where Risk is lying around right now (it's not that bad of a game though), but Catan has always stayed with me.  It's a great combination of theme and mechanics, everything works neatly together. Best family game of all times, for sure.  Dont like the new plastic pieces though.

1151|Biarien|10.0|Settlers is great for its accessibility to new players and the way the game encourages player interaction. The variable board setup adds replayability and long-term interest, while the (mostly) static number arrangement ensures the probabilities are always balanced, even when some resources are scarce. The element of luck can be overly strong at some times, particularly if one player gets a string of bad rolls at the beginning of the game. In other games (Tigris & Euphrates, Puerto Rico, etc.), the player can always take some productive action even when luck is not on his side; in Settlers, the player simply cannot act. I would like to see an official way to mitigate bad luck, but some version of the '[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/150443/the-famous-welfare-variant]welfare variant[/url]' should work well enough. While I appreciate that trading keeps players engaged, I do not enjoy the mechanic as much as other modes of player interaction, as I feel like I have to 'act' in order to play well. For this reason, the game isn't at the top of my list, but I do enjoy playing it with the right group. [8] (2012-03-23)  After many more plays of Settlers, my appreciation for the game -- and rating -- has improved greatly. Strings of good/bad luck can still hurt, but with good placement (diverse numbers) and repeated play, I don't see it as a major flaw in the game; rather, it is most often the result of a flaw in a player's initial placements. Sometimes it's not, but that's to be expected in a game with dice, and it's not likely to happen again in the next game (or if it does, it's an indication that the fault may in fact be with the player). I will now gladly recommend Settlers and will play it any time I am offered the chance to do so, especially with 4 players (3 is also ok; 5 and 6 work but 4 is preferable). I appreciate the fact that though the game is fairly simple (very few rules) and repetitive (each turn offers the same single mandatory action and few voluntary actions, compared to worker placement or role selection games), the game is still tense and exciting due to the competition for key settlement spots, the need to make a critical trade, and the fear of letting one player get too much of a lead before others are positioned to catch up. A great design worthy of all the praise it has received. [8 -> 10] (2014-01-22)|13|Catan

Slow players can spoil the game, simply because there is no excuse for AP; decisions are rarely difficult (initial settlement placement excepted). Has a lovely acceleration towards the end game, when 3 players (4 if you're lucky, but more typically someone is being crushed) are often in with a shot of winning if the dice roll their way. Fun with kids if you give them a smaller VP target (e.g. 7 or 8 vs. 10 for adult). Liked this game enough to make a custom 3D board... guess it has to be a 10.|13|Catan

1353|Mr Frooples|10.0|Best all-round game design I've ever seen, simply because it's good for so many different kinds of players and is so well-balanced and replayable.  Agricola, Puerto Rico, etc. are better strategy designs, but they have a higher entry bar.|13|Catan
1354|alefnought|10.0|Pretty much tied with Boggle for my favorite game. Settlers has so much room for change with the unique board for every game, and the complete arbitrariness of luck on the dice roles that I almost never get tired of playing. The game is great both for 3 or 4 players, with each situation providing for a very different kind of game. It's also possible to combine two sets of the game to play with 5-7 players (though I wouldn't recommend going over 6), and without needing to buy any of the expensive expansions. Every time I introduce a friend to this game, they get hooked by about half-way through the first game. Settlers is a great strategy game which doesn't rely solely on brute force and has no military based. Rather, one relies on trading resources as well as timely and intelligent use of them buy, barter and build one's way to victory. Highly addicting, but you'll never regret getting hooked!|13|Catan

1550|Ash1138|10.0|It's popular for hard core gamers to dismiss this game in favor of more elite, less mainstream games, but Settlers of Catan stands in my opinion as one of the best games ever designed. It's important to note expansions should be added at your own risk. I feel they just muck up a perfectly elegant design with unneeded additives and try to turn the game into something it's not. The core, 4-player game is the only version I want to play. If I want to play something else, there are other great games. |13|Catan

1573|Teach101|10.0|"New  My personal Gateway Game.  Although more strategic than most games that are called ""Gateways"", Catan is a game that is easily taught and you can start playing quickly (even though you don't know what you are doing yet.)  We have worn out one set of cards. We don't play it as much which is sad.  Just a great game.  Oversaturation to the point where people are tired of seeing CATAN, you are deceiving yourself if you can't see the quality of this game."|13|Catan

When it comes to rankings, people tend to rip on it despite the fact they have probably gamed it 10+ times.  Popularity comes with a backlash.  Works best with only 4.

Those with some appreciation for economics will also love how features of real markets--profit, fluctuating prices, and comparative advantage--emerge without being dictated in the rules.  Get the 5-6 player expansion and use it even for 4-player games; the more open island keeps players who get off to a slow start from becoming frustrated in their attempts to build.|13|Catan

1853|kolonalkurtz|10.0|"This is the game that got me into the hobby, as seems to be the case for a lot of people on BGG. It also appears that many have abandoned the game as too ""random."" I've toyed with posting a defense of Catan in the forums, but I think there are several threads already discussing that. In short, the strategy is certainly obscured somewhat by the dice rolling mechanic, but to argue the game is random or luck based is far from the truth. After countless plays both in person and on XBox Live, I argue that the number of games that are severely tainted by absurd dice rolling statistics are fairly rare. Much more often, mistakes in judgement, or strokes of genius drive the outcome. Most importantly, getting the final 1-3 points often feels like a rewarding puzzle. Throw in that there is usually at least one other person vying for those points, and you have a quite satisfying climax."|13|Catan

The game is based enough on luck that a newbie can reasonably have a chance but based enough on skill that experienced players will have the edge. The social aspect of this game is brilliant. Half the fun is not spent actually playing the game, but rather playing with friends or complete strangers and making stupid jokes about ""building a walmart"" that ""buys out the other settlements"". If you can, purchase this game. You won't regret it."|13|Catan

Up until I played Catan (circa 2005) the games I mainly played were Risk!, Samurai Swords (Ikusa), and Strat-o-matic Bball.  Catan served its purpose well of a gateway game.  I played this game (usually 1-3 in one sitting) and its variants once a week with a gaming group (usually 4-6 players) for about 2 years.  Catan led me to playing other games from other publishers and is no longer played much at all.  Nonetheless, Catan is in my hall of fame.  |13|Catan

2059|hipp5|10.0|This is the game that started it all for me. Now it's four years later, and no matter how many other games I try I can always be convinced to go back and play a game of Settlers.  This game is everything a board game should be. It's simple enough on the surface that anyone can pick it up, but there's enough depth of strategy that you'll be just as entertained on the 50th play through. Games are long enough to be satisfying, but you don't have to give up an afternoon to play. It has the perfect level of randomness; skilled players win more often than not, but it doesn't mean they always do (which keeps it fun for all). Last of all, the shifting board and the importance of politics make this game endlessly replayable.  The only con I can see is that sessions of this game have on occasion almost descended into fisticuffs over particularly jerk trades.  |13|Catan

2096|Xitomatl|10.0|I give it a 10, not because it is the best game ever, but because for what it is, it's basically perfect.  The key is not expecting more from it than what it is -- a light, luck-based social game.  It's qualities make it the most played game I own, largely because most of my friends are non-gamers -- for now.   |13|Catan

2138|Seal Bludgeoner|10.0|Settlers of Catan moved me from Chess into board games. If I mess up in Chess, it's my fault and I am punished through the rest of the game. In Settlers of Catan, if I mess up, I have many options to recover. Let's face it, Settlers is the best game out there. People complain about luck and dice and, well, that's life, suck it up. This allows experts to have an advantage, but it always allows other players to be included. Strategy, interaction, little downtime, re-playability - Settlers of Catan has it all. Don't let people complain about thinking that it has too much luck. It is good to lose sometimes, even though you are as prepared as possible. This got most of us into board games, and is available everywhere for good reason.  |13|Catan

2160|FilterJoe|10.0|I can only think of 3 games I've played hundreds of times and this is one of them. It has relatively simple rules and a randomness associated with setup and resource production which leads some people to believe that this game is more luck than skill. They are wrong. A combination of strategy , trading, and diplomacy can overcome bad initial setups and bad rolls of the dice.  The only thing that stops very experienced players from winning the vast majority of games against less experienced players is that the less experienced players learn after a few games that their only chance is to gang up on the more experienced/skilled player if it looks like they're in the lead. And that leads to more experienced players adopting strategies that make it appear as if they're behind in the first half of the game even though they're setting themselves up for a sprint at the end . . .  One thing I particularly love about this game are the slow-the-leader mechanisms (robber, trading embargoes, development cards) that makes it possible for people to come back from behind and win, which keeps everyone engaged, and makes this game fun to play even when player age and/or skill level is a wide range. |13|Catan

Even after so many years it is the first one that gets picked when I want to introduce new people to the tabletop gaming fraternity. It's simple. The rules are easy to teach. People learn how to play and get into the game quickly. It provides a lot of player interaction. And almost every time this game is rolled out for a gaming session, it never stops at just one game, someone always says ""Ooh, can we play again? I know what I want to try this time..."" There is an element of luck, yes. But also the chance for negotiation and strategy."|13|Catan

Apesar de haver algumas regras, rapidamente os iniciantes pegam a mecânica do jogo, e não raro um iniciante ganha de pessoas mais experientes. O jogo conta com a sorte dos dados, sendo imprescindível escolher os terrenos com alta probabilidade de sair no dado (6 e 8), além de ser importante ter terrenos com minérios e trigo, estratégia mais comuns nos jogadores mais experientes... |13|Catan

A game that frankly LOOKS boring holding it in the store turned out to be a huge winner in my immediate family.   My kids LOVE the trading aspect of the game and so do my wife and I.   Very fun, satisfying to win game.  Hate the Robber.  Lastly, THIS game at mere mention of playing it has my kids off their computers, putting their tablets down, and other forms of passive entertainment away.   It's a real family together time game, major success."|13|Catan

2772|RobertMosimann|10.0|Settlers of Catan with all its variants, is in my opinion perhaps the finest board game ever designed. Whereas Twilight Struggle and Through the Ages are both very flawed games which are insanely highly rated on Board Game Geek, Settlers of Catan is an unflawed masterpiece of game design. This should be rated #1 on BGG instead of #100.  When 25-30% of the people rating Twilight Struggle have never even played the game and the game reinforces American political delusions and thus is quite harmful in fostering such prejudices; in contrast Settlers of Catan is pure gold deserving of the number one rating when all of the hype from BGG is cut through.|13|Catan

2806|voyager2102|10.0|One of my favorite games. I've been playing this since it came out in Germany and it was the first game I gave to my wife long before we married and it is still her favorite game. It's a game for the whole family and can be easily tought to friends willing to try board games. Even young children can play the game (mine wanted to change over from the kid version to the adult version at around age 6). Depending on the group you play with this can be a very communication intensive game as the trade aspect will decide the game most of the time. There is however a chance that luck will screw you but I play the game with statistics in mind, so I know things like that smooth out with the size of the sample ;)|13|Catan

2902|MD Commish|10.0|"I've gotten into the hobby for a little more than a year as of this writing. I realize this game is now generally thought to be past its time, and its merits as a ""gateway game"" are questioned, but it was the gateway game for me and my game group, and we do go back to this game regularly.  I've found it useful as a parent, my kids have learned the basics of setting up a game, taking turns, rolling dice, gathering resources, building, etc. They don't like the robber much at all (who does), and I found it interesting and funny when they banish the robber to a part of the board that isn't inhabited, so it doesn't hurt anybody.   When this game goes bad for a particular player, it definitely is frustrating eg. when the rolls aren't going your way or the robber is on you constantly as the rest of the table gangs up on you. And the 5-6 player expansion is not as enjoyable. Nevertheless the controlled but open negotiation of trades generally keeps people engaged throughout the game.  Our favourite ""base game"" is to add in the fish from Traders and Barbarians (takes away the desert, and gives the table another resource), and to also play with the Harbor Master to go along with the Longest Road and the Largest Army.   The 10 rating is in part given to historical context of my own personal journey into this hobby, as it is far and away the game I've played the most, that I continue to enjoy. It's also boosted up by our ""base game"" add-ins from the expansions. ""Vanilla"" Catan I would rate around 8 out of 10. "|13|Catan

3126|Great Raldo|10.0|A beautifully simple game.  The rules can be taught in a couple of minutes and due to the changing board and dice roles every game is different.  I've played literally hundreds of games and they're always fun.  Yes, sometimes you can have run away winners, and with the huge amounts of luck involved you can have a very poor game without really doing anything wrong, but the game is quick enough to play a few times an evening.  The more you play the more you find ways to mitigate against all the dice roles and maximise your resources, and quite quickly you find the number of games where you think you were unlucky dramatically starts to drop.|13|Catan

Occasionally we'll venture away from the game to try another, but we always come back to Catan.  The game is extremely repayable as the board game is set up differently each time you play, offering different strategies and obstacles to overcome every time.  This game isn't too heavy.  It doesn't feel like a game of chess, but it's not all up to the dice rolls either.  The balance between luck and strategy is like milk and cookies, a perfect balance and combination.  |13|Catan

3239|AnthonyDuricko|10.0|Like it or lump it, Catan remains the perfect gateway game, bridging the gap between casual board games and board games as a hobby. Pulls off strategy-and-luck-based gameplay with a delightful elegance that remains unreplicated to this day.

3496|ronrubin|10.0|The father of all modern board games. A brilliant and very fun game, with hands-down the most enjoyable player interaction out there in a euro-style board game. And after over 20 years it is still just as enticing and exciting as it was when it just came out! Now THAT'S something I doubt I'll ever say about another board game.|13|Catan

3690|MeggieMarie|10.0|A lot of people hate on this game, but really, it's what started it all for me, and whenever I introduce someone to a new game, it's generally Catan. It's a great gateway game, and gets so many people into euro gaming... So it will always be a 10 in my book. No matter how many times I play it, how random it can be with the dice rolling, it's just an overall great game. |13|Catan

3839|MichielTummers|10.0|"Play this mostly on playcatan.com.  In an age where euros have minimal player interaction, maximum spreadsheet optimalisation, Catan almost feels like a ""modern"" counter to this movement in optimalisation puzzels.   While ages older, it has what i love the most in a game; player interaction, active persuation, multiple strategies and tactics, some randomness and it packs in only an hour give or take.  Will always play this over any optimalisation puzzle where everyone just stares in silence to a board for 4 hours on end."|13|Catan

Love the interaction, negotiation, and dice rolling. Recently included game mechanic in that post dice roll any player that does not receive a resource collects a gem then on your turn trade 3 gems for any resource. This helps keep players involved and speeds up the game as well|13|Catan

Fantastic game mechanics, unique set ups, and nuanced strategy. It's best played with 4 players.  The 5-6 ""extensions"" make the game considerably longer, but change the strategy as well.  The artwork is now classic, especially with the recent 2010's version."|13|Catan

4298|sutrebuh|10.0|A game for statisticians: Catan cannot be won if the right numbers do not come. Nevertheless it is not a gambling game, because the different probabilities of two dice should be known. Those who are surprised that 2 and 12 are rarely rolled miss the appeal of the game. It's not about playing chess and it's not about gambling either, it's about improving your chances in a calculated way. Moreover, the game does not follow a more or less sophisticated game mechanics, but leaves the players room to make each other's lives difficult. This build-up game also appeals to children and it is a pleasure to see them grow into the mechanisms of trading and tactics.|13|Catan

4684|bartok8|9.99|"It's a classic.  Sure, the re-designs and name change are annoying (it's ""The Settlers of Catan"" to me and always will be), but it's the ultimate taste maker that broke through and got itself on the public radar.  You'll always find people to play it.    Also it's the only game containing free-structure trading that really works, IMHO.  "|13|Catan

4719|joords|9.8|"Another incredible game.  I don't play it as much anymore, but it still comes out occasionally.  However, for people who are just new to the hobby, it's a great way to get them hooked.  and with the expansions, it just soars.  A high level of randomness turns me off a bit but this is also what appeals to non-gamers who have grown up on Monopoly and other ""Roll and Move"" games. 5/10/09 Update: This games rating has gone up to a 9 for the number of times we play it.  Easily over 50 ftof games in the last 2 months.  Has to be a 9 if it's played that much.  I now use it to convince all my ""Non-gaming"" friends to try board games."|13|Catan

4741|domcrap|9.75|Settlers of Catan  IMNSHO, this is the best multiplayer negotiation game ever to hit the market!  It has an incredible depth to its strategy that gets overlooked by “gamers” because they dislike the amount of luck in the game.  I used to despise the luck factor because I wanted to win if I was the best player at the table.  Now I'm just as interested in who I get to play with.  and the great amount of luck in Settlers makes the outcome of each game unpredictable even when I am playing with non-gamer friends.  At the same time, I am never bored during these games because the optimal strategy is in continual flux.  I am always amazed by how difficult it is to determine the value of each resource as the game proceeds.  Learning how to negotiate with different types of players is another aspect that never gets boring.  I have played this game well over 50 times and I still enjoy it.  This is unusual for me as I normally get tired of games that I can play with non-gamers after 1 - 3 tries.|13|Catan

(I haven't seen this particular variant listed anywhere in the years since.)  As in ""Poverty Is No Dishonor"", a player who receives no resource on any single dice-roll receives a chip.  On his turn, if he has as many chips as he has visible points, he must trade them in to the bank for a resource of his choice.  This mitigates luck and helps less as a player's position becomes stronger.  I would not rate this game so highly if we did not play with this variant.  [COLOR=#006600][b]Why we own it: [/b][/COLOR]   This game is comfort-food for my gamer's soul.  In all the years since discovering Settlers, I think it's fair to say that almost all of our game purchases have been in the hopes of finding other games that please us as much as Settlers.

The fourth edition was printed in color, making the illustrations that much more helpful. [COLOR=#006600]Learning Curve: [/COLOR] Rather involved, yet intuitive.  In only a couple of rounds, a new player will have the gist. (Best to learn from an experienced player, rather than from the rulebook.) [COLOR=#006600]Depth: [/COLOR]Placement and expansion are quite strategic, but the social aspects dominate. [COLOR=#006600]Luck: [/COLOR]Dice can be cruel, so initial placement is crucial.

Sure, the dice may be unfriendly and give you nothing for a while, but for the most part, the game rewards the players who plan best and make the best choices.  When I first got onto BGG, this game was still rated an 8, but now it's fallen quite a bit.

4889|phk975|9.5|March 2010: This game stands the test of time. I am a proud board gamer due 100% to this game. It just works. It's well designed and has interesting mechanics like negotiation that negates some of the luck factor of dice-rolling. Great gateway game that I'm still happy to play and teach to potential new gamers. Scoring a 9.5 for replayability, longevity, and ease of learning.|13|Catan

4925|SeanBrown|9.5|The basic game is great, but the myriad variations and expansions make this one of the best games, period. Easy to learn, not so easy to master. The one downside is that when all players are skilled at the game, it often just comes down to how the dice roll and where you are in the order of initial selection. If you haven't played Catan and play board games, what are you waiting for?|13|Catan

4928|mFiend|9.5|I came late to the world of Catan, but after having the game's merits described to me, I took a chance and brought the box home from the game shop.   I have never once been disappointed by this game. It's a perfect mix of strategy and simplicity. Everyone gamer I know loves this game, and there's good reason for it. The game mechanics are simple to learn and understand, but the strategy and luck elements keep it interesting (or frustrating) every time.  Setup time is relatively quick after the first few plays, and average game time has been around an hour depending on how chatty people get during trading and making up elaborate stories about why they're attempting to dominate sheep production.  I've never had this much fun simply playing a game and not caring whether I'm winning or losing. My experience with Settlers of Catan is becoming the standard by which I judge all other games.|13|Catan

You can knock yourself out of the running within the first ten seconds of the game, which can produce some icky feelings of remorse. For new players, I recommend playing with a fixed setup variant.|13|Catan

5048|Sildric Stormwind|9.5|Catan, such a classic game. This is the definitive board gamer's game. It is expandable, full of strategy and is truly the definition of next level of board game beyond the Monopolys and Sorrys of this world. I have had a great deal of game nights in which the only game we played was Catan, and while I cannot say it is my all time favourite board game, I can say it is in the top 10. The only issues Catan struggles with is how brutal bad luck can be. Running low on luck (especially in the 4 or 6 player games) can make the game painfully slow and impossible to win if you get locked in.to a corner. This doesn't happen often to skilled players, but when it does it can just make the game drag on. I also added Harbor Master to the game and kept it at 10 points to win to keep things moving smoothly towards the end of the game. Overall, Catan is a classic everyone who is a gamer should own.|13|Catan

5153|SashaVukovic|9.4|3-6 Player:  The second oldest game in my collection. I think Settlers of Catan is brilliant and really simple. It is very much responsible for getting me started into board gaming, and I still think it is a great unique design. It is also the best board game for trading. And I love Cities and Knights.

Catch-phrases from Settlers are entering mainstream culture the same way ""Do not pass Go"" and ""Free Parking"" have from Monopoly.

Guess it's the combination of hoping that the dice will score your crops together with the trading part of the game. Also fun to build, try to block other players and plan in the beginning where to put your starting markers. The robber is surely also part of the games success. The game is a nice mixed between skill, luck and social skills.|13|Catan

I think that the player who goes first/last during the round in which the settlements are placed is at a high disadvantage. (At least, that seems to be the case in the four-player games.) Also, during some games, you can tell very early on who will be the winner, or at least who will be contenders for the winning spot. If you are not one of the contenders, the game is a real drag and you have to finish out the game.|13|Catan

5414|molnar|9.0|Excellent potential for getting future gamers hooked. Good variety with all the different expansions as random setup. Excellent player interaction - the more the merrier. I love playing 6-player with everything, where the trading is intense. I've played enough that I really do need to replace my resource cards. (Only started logging plays in 2003.)  And yet tonight, it is no longer a 10 for me. There's just too much sensitivity to the initial setup, and once in a while the game just becomes a chore. It's not short enough that you can just wipe that off and play again, so it's not a 10.|13|Catan

5421|Jeff|9.0|I give Settlers a 10 - it's not my favorite game (that award goes to Twilight Struggle), but I have to recognize what Settlers of Catan has done for board games.  It's introduced a lot of my non-gaming friends to a new world of board games.  For that, and elegant gameplay, I give Settlers a perfect 10.  Update (Summer 2012):  Moved to a 9, as I rarely play it anymore.  But it's still a classic, and incredibly important to the hobby.  |13|Catan

5498|Phrim|9.0|Settlers of Catan is the classic eurogame of building settlements and cities on the vertices of a hex map in order to produce resources when the numbers on those hexes are rolled.  Not only do you have to manage the probabilities associated with rolling 2d6, but also the types of resources you receive (which build different things) and the spatial aspect of having to build only next to things you already own.  Trading adds another thing to think about in the game, and can help mitigate the dice luck, but also can create player-enforced balance (no one trades with the leader).  After all these years, Settlers is still a favorite of mine.   (5+ plays)|13|Catan

5546|sallerj|9.0|This game is very easy to learn, but not at all deficient in terms of strategic content. There is luck involved, but the strategy is based partly on understanding the probability distribution (the game and rules are designed to remind us of this ad nauseum) involved, and each game ought to provide a large enough sample of dice throws to have a fairly normal distribution.  It is not easy, however, to pick an optimal strategy. Like Go, it seems that this game cannot be reasoned out by brute force-- players must be able to adapt to their current situation and pick an optimal move using a sort of sliding time scale.  I have only played this game a handful of times, but I expect that I will continue to enjoy it and refine my strategy for a long time.|13|Catan

5558|seppo21|9.0|This is a game I have never tired of.  I really enjoy the trading element.  However, this can be annoying when playing with someone who will not really trade.  In my experience, the dice do not beat people with superior play.  Sure people have dry spells from time to time, but you have to adapt.  Those who adapt best, win.  Same goes with being shut out.  I have only seen one time where a person was truly shut out of a game, and he could probably have still competed -- if he had actually tried.  All in all, a lot of fun.  For the record, Seafarers is not my cup of tea and C&K is not on my desired to play list. |13|Catan

5626|bonkee3000|9.0|UPDATE: 01/10 - Well, I've been the hobby for quite a long while, and even though I don't play Settlers with my gaming partners much any more, I still use it as my main game to bring people into the hobby, and I still always have fun when I play it.  One caveat - I only like playing it as a 4-player game.  With 3, I think the board is too 'open' (Play RA instead!)  ---  A classic.  Settlers introduced me to the world of 'real' games.  I've played it a ton a times, and still never say no to a round.|13|Catan

5629|sddude|9.0|The game that got me started on the voyage of board gaming... this game took the original idea of board gaming and turned it upside down on its head. Certainly, games of its caliber had existed before, but this raised the bar for how gamers while away their hours. Also helping it was the fact that it is very newbie friendly. Its greatest strengths are its elegant simplicity and variable map board. It has enough building and options to keep you entertained. It is criticized heavily for randomness in the dice rolls though, but that doesn't bother me too much.|13|Catan

5808|Belash|9.0|Quite simply, the best game I have ever played.  This was my first Eurogame and I am truthfully not sure if I would have become as hooked as I am now playing any other game.  I believe that this remains the best game to introduce nongamers to when trying to convert them to Eurogames.  Further, if the nongamer has a dice game background, such as Monopoly, it makes my argument stronger as they will be comfortable with the dice roll.  The rules are quite simple and after a ten minute quick explanation and quick couple of rounds, most newbies will have things down pat.  Settlers has some randomness to the game as resource production is determined through the roll of dice, but more often then not I find that the person who manages their resources best wins the game.  Trading plays a very important roll in this as people who are able to complete more trades improve their position more often then not.  This game is a lot of fun and very addicting!  A must have for every gamer and a great way to send you down the path of gaming for nongamers.|13|Catan

5871|sisteray|9.0|At one time I used to think this was one of the greatest games ever made.  Now I know better.  Still, though, it can be fantastic, but it really is prone to certain circumstances.  If the dice get screwy it can make for a long and arduous game. When playing with 4 there is enough opportunity to yield resources so that when your turn comes around you have something to do, but of course one player gets the bone usually and gets pinched out (although there are enough other things that they can still do to win if they don't get too worked early on in the game).  With 3 even more dependent on dice rolls to yield for you to be able to do anything that turn.  I would never give up my copy, as it still hits the table fairly often.  UPDATE: You know, the rating on this has gone all over the place depending on how jaded I am, but in reality, this is a damn fine game.  Really one of the best of its kind.|13|Catan

5887|thugbert|9.0|I have played this a lot and still enjoy it.  Has a fair amount of luck, but that is what makes it fun!  The roll of the dice affects everyone and is met by cheers and groans each turn!  I also think that there is a lot more strategy and skill involved than many people give it credit for.  If you play board games to have fun with your friends and family, then you should check out this game.  When I play with my family I stick it to my brother by blocking his roads and trading tough, but I'm nice to my mom by giving her what she needs in trades.  This is one of the few games where you can be both nice and mean, which makes it suitable for most any mix of people.|13|Catan

5916|Orski|9.0|The gateway game, Catan is a modern classic. Trading resources keeps everyone involved and offers high enough interaction between players. It looks simple but under surface it offer surprisingly deep gaming experience. Only reason why I usually wouldn't suggest Settlers in a gaming night is the fact there are games I haven't played as much and want to try them instead. Best with 4 players, I'd rather play something else with 3.  Update (15.5.2009) : My rating for Catan has shifted between 6-9 during my time on BGG. (Rating of 6 was when I had overplayed). Right now it feels that because of intense gaming experiences (when played with 4 players) it offers every time when you play it, it deserves at _least_ a rating of 9.   Update (28.6.2018) : That is if everyone play cuthroath enough. Even one player making too loose trades (that benefit too much one party breaks game a bit. When played with players of similar skill it is tense, good game even after 20 years. A modern classic.|13|Catan

I know a lot of people have played Settlers to the point of burn-out, but I am no where near that point yet.  I love the interaction of the trading phases, playing the seemingly fickle bell curve (Another six??? How's about an eight every once in a while??), and beating an opponent in a race to a crucial intersection.  We are still developing theories about the relative importance of each commodity (Good ol' rock, nothing beats rock), discussing whether nines are actually better than eights due to the robber effect, and making lots of sheep jokes.  To put it simply, Settlers is a lot of fun. |13|Catan

6061|dbaxter|9.0|I rate this game 9 because it is a great game but also considering the following...  We never play it anymore without Seafarers and almost never without Cities and Knights as well.  But Settlers is a terrific game even without the expansions.  The masterful balance of strategy and luck is just right.  You have to be able to adjust your strategy frequently. You can achieve a sense of accomplishment in obtaining one goal and then refocusing your effort to the next development in your game plan. It is exciting to disguise your agenda by building many things at once at the risk of someone (or yourself) rolling a 7 or the risk of an opponent building in your way.  One of my favorite things about this game, however, is to see the blank stare of quite clever people as the game is explained to them for the first time and then seeing how quickly they pick it up when we play.|13|Catan

One of the very best, and will go down as one of the all time classics.  Can millions of people really be wrong?  In this case, an emphatic NO!  (Admittedly, I'd rather play Cities & Knights than basic Catan at this point... but that surely isn't a knock against this fantastic game.  Indeed, I rate Settlers higher by .5 simply because it's far easier to get to the table and play in a reasonable time.  The wrong group kills C&K.)|13|Catan

So much depends on the initial placement that it can be frustrating for someone new, so the recommended setup can ease this. I still love to play it and I can't see that ever changing.

6210|mtlawson|9.0|"It's not a perfect game, it's theme doesn't exactly match the mechanics and it does have that random element that probably drives some people nuts, but judging by the amount of time spent on the table it's still our gaming group's favorite game.    I have bought the Seafarers expansion and played a game of that, but I personally prefer the original.  Settlers is an ""island"" generated by laying hexes of various resources (+ one desert), and then surrounding it by sea hexes.  Numbers (reflecting die rolls, which also includes probabilities in a simple dot system) are placed on each of resources, and the black piece -called The Robber- is placed in the desert.  The mechanic of placing settlements over corners of hexes and then a road segment adjacent to it seems at first blush to favor the player who places two settlements in a row, but that is not the case as smart roadbuilding and sticking to a sound strategy will win out in general.  The rolling of the dice to get resources makes a statistician want to play the resources with the best chance of coming up (6 and 8, because 7 moves the Robber), but if those resources are mainly wood and brick, then in the late game that doesn't help you very much.  You have to balance out the early game (building roads and settlements) with the late game (cities, soldier cards, and development cards)."|13|Catan

6316|ronlee|9.0| Excellent introduction to german games for a number of reasons:       The number of brain parts stimulated in the game is large, though stimulation is fairly gentle.  This is not your hitachi magic wand vibrator that focuses on one organ and wiggles the hell out of it. no.  it's more like a vibrating tub of warm, soft jello that you jump into hairless and naked, all nerve endings exposed. there's cajoling, laughter, tension, secrets and bluffing, memory, press your luck, arms races, strategic thinking, tactical considerations, the joy of building.     there's just a *little* viciousness, enough to make the game juicy, but not enough to provoke any real hurt feelings (for most people).    virtually zero downtime for anybody, as everyone is interested in everything that happens at all times.   the game has been designed to give every person playing the hope of winning at all times, even if it's the smallest glimmer.  the person that is waay too far in the lead can be effectively slowed down by other players, leading to close, tense finishes.  Some here have argued that this aspect makes it an inferior game, as skill is constantly being stymied by luck and group-lynching, but I believe that a game for non-gamers should allow everyone the possibility of winning.       On the minus side, the start-up is intimidating (to a non-gamer), as rules are moderately complicated, and the board looks geeky, with the hexagons and #s and pips.  But most non-gamers with whom I've played have warmed to the game after playing just two rounds, and are extremely enthusiastic (and exhausted) by the end.  Complexity is an issue, however, for grandma or grandpa who have trouble with all the rules.  |13|Catan

For us, though, I will want the C&K expansion for sure!  Played MANY 2 players variant game and increased my rating from a 7 to a 9. I guess that 4 is probably the best number, more is not better in this case. IMO.  Traded for this game. THANKS! :D|13|Catan

6334|breity|9.0|With four players, this is about as perfect a game as I could hope for. I've lured more people into gaming with this game than anything else. My only complaint is if the ore and brick end up having rare numbers on them, you're going to be in for an excruciating game. Also, I've seen people through no fault of their own get boxed into an area and thus it becomes an impossibility for them to win (because there aren't enough victory points in the deck, and that ends up being their only option). That sort of thing doesn't bother me so much in conflict-oriented games, but in a game like Settlers, it can be a drag. Still, this game is usually a tremendously entertaining time.|13|Catan

6353|indiana27|9.0|I played this many times over a year ago and stopped since we typically played with the expansions and found them time consuming as well as found new games to play that were intersting.  I played this again on Dec 20, 2006 with a group from work and it was refreshing to play again.  We played with another member's board so it was a little confusing since his game was the original series and mine was the recent version.  This game takes some time to setup and go over the rules, however it's simple once you have the hang of it.  It has just the right amount of strategy and luck to make it enjoyable for everyone.  In the game we played we were shorted brick so it was a scramble to build much with those components so we spent most of our time trading in goods for what we needed.  Rock and Wheat were in over abundance.|13|Catan

6364|skolenik|9.0|The game has a good deal of intertia, in terms of developing slowly and to a good deal due to initial placement. The staged nature (initial expansion through roads and ships), however, gives way to intensive expansion (upgrading cities), and that's where the pattern of the game may change quickly. The US version seems to be designed/implemented somewhat more poorly than the original German Die Siedler: the tiles are of rather weird and poorly understandable colors. The expansion potential is nice. The give away that we allow for our 7-yr old is to let him start with more cities.|13|Catan

Plus the old Mayfair edition that I have has very average artwork.  I marvel at the design genius of Settlers, but not the game play. I just don't enjoy it all that much. In my opinion, it takes a bit too long to play.  The foodstamp variant helps balance the luck of the dice.  I have had little luck using this as a gateway game, many others work better.|13|Catan

6514|Benjaminviking|9.0|Always like to play this one.  I still haven't played enough games to solidify a strategy I like or works consistently.  Rating may decrease when (if) I get stuck in a strategy rut, but for now the replayability and interactive aspects keep me coming back for more.  Another game my wife will play with me, and more often than not dominates.  (That helps her coming back for more, too.) [Market price]|13|Catan

6551|alita_4b|9.0|The perennial game - a classic. My game group played countless games over the years, before we even heard of BGG. We've had marathon gaming nights lasting until dawn. We even keep a game log (complete with questions/answers to complex game situations and a list of winners).  Even though SoC is a dice game with a med-high luck factor, my group believes that you can effectively strategize and change tactics depending on what's rolled and what resources people have. Why build a settlement on the 8 or 9 when the 10 or 11 is hot? What do you do when 3 is rolled 3 times in a row and the 6 hasn't been rolled all game? Where's the best place to put the robber, on a hot number or a more likely number?   The player interaction level is fairly high too. Screw someone too early in the game, you have an enemy working against you. If you take the lead too early, you're a marked player. We love to talk during trades too (look, my sheep is better!). And perish the thought of trading someone with 7+ points, you'll be heckled for the rest of the game. Oh look, so-and-so has all those development cards, must be victory points, they are in the lead! Hours of fun!  I rate plain SoC higher than the expansions because it's fast-paced and easy, and we can get in multiple games in a night. Also, SoC games are typically close games where everyone has an active role. Even if it's a blowout, it's usually quick and painless.   Played SoC dozens of times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 50-100 games).  UPDATE: Finally played this again after a long hiatus. We started with the sample board and starting positions to even out the board for the 2 new players. Turned out, the sample board was awful - poor settlement and road placements that didn't make sense (for example, some second round choices settlement and road placements would have been better in other places).   New version: Flimsy board pieces, ports are permanently set on border pieces, but they don't sit well to frame the hexagonal board.   Tracked on family list (grooven)!|13|Catan

I don't enjoy having my cards taken away/stolen from me so it may not be a keeper from my point of view, I felt very picked on and nearly sulked hahaha. Nearly 8 year old son liked to collect soldiers to have the largest army so that was his tactics. I did win the game tho so that will ensure another game or two :b  Second game and I like it a lot more, DS ( now aged 8 ) won. His tactic of buying the Development cards a lot of the time is not such a bad idea!!

6778|mjdart|9.0|"We don't play it as often as we used to, but we've had many fun games of Settlers.  If it had a decent 2-player game, we would likely have played it a lot more.  The tile-constructed board, and differing scarcity of resources makes each game different, and gives the game enduring appeal.  The game naturally encourages players to target the leader, which gives some people the grumps, but also produces close finishes with most people ""in the hunt"" until the end.  Still a very enjoyable game, that often earns a place if we have a weekend away.  If I'd started logging plays 5 years earlier, this would probably have another 30 plays against it."|13|Catan

6794|Thommy8|9.0|Settlers was for me, like many others I'm sure, THE gateway game, and will always hold a very special place in my heart.  I actually learned Settlers in 10th grade, every week I would go to a club at Cornell University where a bunch of the college students gathered to play games, almost exclusively Magic: The Gathering. I had been going for a couple years and would continue going for a couple more years, and throughout most of that time I mostly just played/traded Magic, spending far too much money in the process.  One fateful evening, I looked over and saw people playing this rather odd boardgame. Up until that point in my life I'd only played Monopoly, Risk, Life, Backgammon, etc. It looked so strange and interesting, I actually tore myself away from Magic for a few moments to watch. I became so engrossed that I watched the entire game. In fact, up until last year I'd never even read the rule book for Settlers, I simply learned by watching that game very closely. So throughout the years I started to play Settlers from time to time at that club at Cornell.  Eventually I even bought my own copy, which I found at the local comic book store; I bought the old brown Mayfair edition.  And I played this, and I played it some more, actually I played it for years and years.  All the time never stopping to realize that there might be more games out there like this one.  I loved Settlers, but somehow it didn't occur to me that there were other games of the same or similar ilk.  Fast forward a bit, I move to Chicago and go to college, I meet a couple good friends, and show them Settlers, the three of us end up playing Settlers almost every week together, and all this time, never think that there could be any other games out there I should be checking out.  So then I leave the country to study abroad, and while I'm away one of the friends I'd been playing Settlers with tells me about this board game fair on Navy Pier in Chicago and how he found out about and saw all these neat board games somewhat like Settlers but different and great, and they even had a giant life-size 3D version of Settlers.  I'm very jealous, but my interest is piqued.  Shortly thereafter, that same friend goes to California to visit someone, and comes back raving about this incredible game called Carcassonne that he was introduced to and that I just have to play. I'm like Carca-what?  He's like, you haven't heard of it?  I thought you were all into board games, isn't that your thing? And I'm like, uhh, no, I like Settlers, but haven't really ever played any other good games.  Anyway, I blame it all on him (or rather I thank him profusely) because from that point on I decided that maybe board games should be my thing, so I got Carcassonne shortly thereafter, played it, and fell in love with it.  My collection began to grow very quickly indeed, and now I'm as addicted as ever.  So it was Settlers that I played first, and Settlers will probably always be the game that I played most, I still can't believe it didn't occur to me for so long to see if there were more games I might like.

6990|BanjoBob|9.0|After all these years I still really like this game! The player interaction (trading, robber dynamics, etc.) is really the key to the fun here. There's no down time, because during any player's turn there can be haggling and extortion happening.  I think Settlers is at its best when played quickly with only 3-4 players and minimal add-ons.|13|Catan
6991|livejapan|9.0|My copy is actually missing parts but I have friends who own it as well.  One of the first geekworthy board games I played.  Possibly my gateway game.  I still remember the day the group I was with first played the game and the amazement at the ability to do so many different things.  My only dislike of the base game is that the dice never seem to roll anywhere near the numers you would expect on the average.  Then again dice hate me more often than not.  I've advanced on to the expansions now but the base game still gets alot of credit for bringing me into the hobby.|13|Catan

6995|ORDoc|9.0|I was juggling between 8 and 9 for Settlers. Technically, I think the game deserves a 9 for being elegantly simple and always fun to play. I eventually bumped it up to a 9 for the game's uncanny ability to draw non-gamers into the Eurogame genre. I am one of those converts myself.|13|Catan

I don't like the images on the new printings either, but that's just personal preference, and is probably somewhat biased by the fact that since I learned on the old set, the new one ""just doesn't look right."""|13|Catan

SoC - Seafarers adds complexity and some more flexibility to the basic game. But What takes the prize is the SoC - Cities and Knights.

Yes, it can sometimes be unbalanced and a bit random, but good play can mitigate all of that.  4P is the most balanced; 3P can suffer from runaway leader, and the 5-6P expansion is a bad implementation.

7317|Elsilhe|9.0|Yet another follower-placement game (the First that I've owned, in fact!). It's strength lies in replayability, as the gameboard is never the same. And luck goes the same for that matter!  As this game can be played with 2 players, I strongly recommend to gather up at least the third one. In two player games, there's just no need in trading, which in my opinion is one of the most intriguing aspect of the game as it enforces conversation and diplomacy, which is absent from two-player games.  Totally recommended for fans of games like Carcassonne!|13|Catan

7362|14cross|9.0|I like the game but the only problem I have with it is there is a lot of luck involved with the die role. Don't get me wrong, I like some luck in my games. But this one requires too much luck in order to win. For example, I played my 13 year old daughter and son and we all kept rolling 9s all of the time, which gave my daughter tons of resources. She clobbered us, getting 10 points before my son and I got to five points. I bought this game expecting a lot more strategy and was dissapointed.  Edit: I have played this a few more times and, while I still don't see a ton of strategy in this game, I am seeing more possibilities. I think the expansions will probably go a long way toward increasing replayability. I increased the rating from a 7 to a 8.  Edit 2: I got Cities and Knights and it makes this game a solid 9 for me. We're having a lot of fun with it!|13|Catan

7438|Amandil|9.0|Wonderful game--perhaps should be a 10, but I can see that the base game might get old eventually (hence the existence of so many expansions, right?). I have played this more times than my log of plays suggests--probably more like 8 or 10. Initially I found the luck frustrating, but I have learned that much of my frustration came from an overly simplistic understanding of how to place settlements, which led to my not having settlements on a broad enough variety of numbers and resources. Initial placement is maybe a bit too important, but as I have gotten better at that aspect of the game I've enjoyed the game as a whole much more.|13|Catan

7465|gopher37|9.0|This is another game that is great with 6 people (we have the expansion set).  I love the negotiating of resources - I've always liked Monopoly because of this, and the same principles apply in Catan.  The fact that dice rolls can affect who wins the game is not the best game mechanic, because there may be too much chance involved.  But if your placements are evenly spread out among many numbers you can limit this risk - which is a good game strategy.  |13|Catan

7534|trackguyuta|9.0|"Excellent game. There are so many things to like about this game. Everyone is involed every turn so there is no ""dead time"" between your turns. It is simple and it is short but there is a lot to it. I really like the trading aspect of the game. If you are shrewed and trade well you will win a lot of games. Also the other players tend to gang-up on the leader which tends to make every game a close finish which is always exciting. We have played this to death but still enjoy it everytime we play."|13|Catan

7537|Heyswyndon|9.0|A classic, and highly rated in my collection because of its interactiveness and ability to be played by many family members.  This is truely a break-out game for introducing new players to board games.   I have many of the expansions and variants, and have had fun building historical expansions.  (I modeled my own Settlers of Cannan with sculpey and cards, and have turned it into a historically educational variant...)    You have a wide range of complexity, and a great deal of luck within the game, making it addaptable to many audiences.  Finnaly, the end game is very visually appealing, with all the pieces and tiles togther.    Downside is storing all the pieces and parts, keeping instructions of all the variants, and setup time for many of the variants.  Another down side is getting players to not roll the dice into the board!|13|Catan

7555|NedStark|9.0|I will always treasure this game.  It was introduced to my wife and I by some great friends while my wife and I (fiancee at the time) were on a pre-marriage encounter trip in 1999.  It was the first game that I enjoyed since picking up Magic several years earlier.    Anyway, the same friends bought us a copy for our wedding.  The rest is history.  Although we play more Gulo Gulo and Kids of Catan now (2 kids later), my wife and I still love to introduce this game to other couples on date nights.|13|Catan

Easy to learn, I feel like it's a 'Board Game Buffet' for games - it's not the best example of any one game mechanic, but it has a little bit of everything to result in a good time.  The one caveat I have is that setting up the board can be a pain.|13|Catan

UPDATE: The Asobrain implementation -- especially with variant maps -- is phenomenal. UPDATE: Keeping it as a 9 for now, but to be frank I am bored of base Settlers.

Since we've played Settlers of Canaan so much, it's hard to stop calling the robber the plague.  I like the replayability of this game with the mixing up of terrain hexes and port tokens.  Downside: harder to setup and no point tracker.  Update: Since sold Canaan. I really enjoy this with Seafarers and the Fishermen of Catan (Traders & Barbarians).  Family likes it that way too.

Or do you say things like 'A large natural disaster has destroyed an entire island nation and reformed it with a completely different setup of natural landmarks. 4 hardy adventurers are needed to bring civilization to this untamed land. Much danger lies ahead, but this task is essential to bring balance. Do you have the guts to be one of those 4 chosen?'""   ""Also I will kick all yall asses in Catan. I swear on my confederate pride and the grave of Robert E. Lee. When my longest road cuts off your attempt to get to that sheep port, remember the South Will Rise Again.""  BBD: ""There is boring Catan and then there is ""Real World: Catan"" where danger lies ahead and the stakes are high"" Robin: ""Probably the former, but should I be invited to a game of Catan with the latter, I will surely accept.""

7952|Leif_G|9.0|'Settlers' is a fantastic family game. Great for those occasions when you want to host a game that isn't focused on warfare. It really gets people interacting in a big way. Good or bad things can happen to you at any time, even on other players turns. The 5-6 player extensions are great, because they modify the gameplay further, allowing each player the chance to conduct some activity for themselves, on other players turns. It's definately not a game where you get bored waiting for your next turn to roll around. The rules are simple to pick up, and yet the game has tremendous potential for modification or adapting 'house rules'.|13|Catan

8055|sechen_rob|9.0|I can't praise this game enough. It has HANDS DOWN the best player interaction out of any game ever made.  People criticize it for having too much luck, but that just means they aren't very good at it. If you play well, the dice should be heavily mitigated.  The only real flaw with this game is that it's pretty easy to get completely shut out within the first few turns if someone blocks you. This can particularly happen in a 4 player game. Generally this only happens if there are some newbies at the table though.|13|Catan

8079|borislock|9.0|After Carcassonne, Settlers is probably the most played game in my library. This and Stratego Legends were my gateway games. There was a time when I would have rated Settlers an 11, but now I only feel that way about the game when playing with the Cities and Knights expansion. Regardless, I believe that a house may be a house, but it's not a home until it has Settlers.|13|Catan

8202|buraz|9.0|After more than 500 games played (mostly online), I can say that for experienced player this game is very well balanced. It's all about where you put your first settlements: if you know what you're doing, you cannot made a mistake. Once you figure out what numbers can roll how often, even the dice doesn't add to randomness to much. It can surprise sometimes, but for me that's one of the joys of this game (I'll always remember game where we had like 6 two rolled and one 6 :D ).|13|Catan

I love the game because every time you play the board is different.  So its almost like playing an entirely new game every time.    I highly recommend getting this for anyone looking to get into the more advanced board games but don't want to dive into the big expensive monsters quite yet.    Instruction manual is easy to read and to look up things.  Also the useful website where they had game tutorials on how to play helped a ton.  I was able to pick up the game in one night.

8338|feathers|9.0|I love this game.  The production of resource mechanic means it's very difficult for players to be cut out entirely even if others refuse to trade, and in all the games I've played there's never been a serious dispute.  The variety of contributing elements to a win, the modular design for freshness...for me, it's perfect.  I look forward to someday getting the expansion and trying out 5 or 6 players. (9) 2011-04-08  UPDATE - I've played the 5-6 player expansion and like it.  Each player having the option to build at the end of each turn means your plans haven't been lost by the time it takes to go round the table, but in merry circumstances it does help to have someone 'chair' each round.  'Any building? Any other business? No?' (still a 9) 2016-12-08|13|Catan

8360|JennInOz|9.0|We have delayed playing this until our son was 'old enough'. The box recommendations are for 10+ age group. Seeing him take to it so effortlessly in the last few days makes me wish we'd started a year ago when he was 8.   This is an excellent structured game for mid primary and above, which keeps all players involved. Takes us a comfortable hour to play.|13|Catan

8364|RachyJ|9.0|This game usually goes over well with new gamers.  I love the interaction and table talk.  It can be boring if your numbers never come up on the dice, or an opponent blocks you.  There can also be run away leaders.  Even with those issues, the game is fun.  I love the concept of having a wide open board to execute your strategies upon.  One of the few games where I sleeved the cards because it is played that often.|13|Catan

Settlers is a great standard to begin or end a session of gaming because of its 60 minutes or less play time.  Over played on my part now, and use to be a 9, but it is still a fantastic game.|13|Catan

8378|koleeko|9.0|I feel like this one is a gold standard.  It's deep enough for repeated play by serious gamers while easy enough to be enjoyed by newcomers and casual gamers.  It's shocking to me that it isn't rated higher.  Maybe there's a bias against it because it's popular and you can buy it at some mainstream stores.    I was kind of against Catan myself before I played it.  It's hard to get excited about an agriculture based game.  It seems like the most boring thing you could spend an hour involved with. However, first appearances can be deceiving.  Catan is super well balanced, each game is different and there are multiple strategies to winning.  I would be embarrassed if I didn't have this in my collection. |13|Catan

8412|katarakt|9.0|After many years and several thousands of plays (online included), I'm still excited to play this every time I'm offered. I believe that says it all, at least for me. However, an update. Catan sadly breaks down with people who don't play logically (weird trades, weird blockings etc.). It can take the enjoyment down somewhat. So with people who know how to play, it's 10, but the general rating for me has dropped down to 9.|13|Catan

I think playing with Cities and Knights is the best competition and adds complexity to keep it interesting for those seasoned players.  Even though it does not get out often it is still a joy to play. My daughter is just now old enough that she can play a good game. So its getting out more often. It will probably always stay a 9 for me as it has earned a spot as the most influential game in bringing me into modern games.|13|Catan

A true classic, which I can see getting a lot of plays, most of which are balanced. There is a moderate amount of luck, but a good player almost always will beat a bad player. It's also making success with people who aren't ""gamers"" and they even requested to play another matches. I really recommend this to anyone, it's easy, relatively quick, has lots of interaction, an adequate amount of luck and pretty components."|13|Catan

8956|jmganey|9.0|"My gateway game and probably yours, too.  Though I've arguably ""moved on"" from this game, I'll never pass up a chance to play it.  My wife enjoys playing vanilla, but I like adding the River (you might hate it, but I like it), Fisherman, Catan event cards, and Cities and Knights.  Looking to add Seafarers but I need an older copy.  A lot of people hate on Settlers after they graduate to other gaming mechanics, but I think this is wrong.  Settlers is what it is - a VERY well-thought out game that offers much replayability (tiles, resource markers).    Combining Settlers with its expansions--I like to play with The Great River, Fisherman, Event Cards (for the events only), Harbormaster, and Cities and Knights--makes for a long, but enjoyable, experience.  I would recommend this game to anyone trying to get into board gaming, and I'd gladly play Settlers with anyone, even after all these years.  "|13|Catan

8964|HeavenWard|9.0|"It is only fitting that my very first post to this board be towards the first game that opened my eyes to a different level of board games -- and BoardGameGeek.  I would actually have given The Settlers of Catan a ""10"", if it were not for the expansions -- which are even better than the base game, in my opinion.  In any case, this was my first experience with a game of this type.  I grew up in a world of Monopoly, Life, Sorry!, Yahtzee, etc. -- all okay games in themselves, especially when playing with friends and family.  This, however, was the first non video game that really involved some strategy and thought -- and officially blew all of those previous family games out of the water.  It was an instant hit for this family of three!  We rarely play it these days due to our enjoyment of the expansions, but I would still look forward to playing it, if I did not have the expansions at my fingertips.  Overall, a wonderful game that involves thought and strategy, but is not overly deep to frighten gamers new to this realm.  I can definitely see why this is used as a ""gateway game""."|13|Catan

It takes longer while teaching new players, but experienced players can pop a game out in 30 minutes. Good game!|13|Catan

9190|AKARewer|9.0|its a very, very cool game indeed. working your way to victory means being very friendly but also deceive your opponents by either bringing then of the track with trading or by offering then what they need to simply build a street whilst you can get the final victory point with that city your going to build right away.  swearing and being an aggressive or arrogant derp doesn't really help your game plan so I think being polite and friendly during the game gives you the best game experience.  there are some cons though.  there is little fun playing against people who don't have a lot of experience playing strategy games. settlers of catan requires some sort of foresight into what's going to happen on the board to make it the silently competitive game it is meant to be.|13|Catan

9223|Sixmoons|9.0|One of the most popular euros for a good reason. Everything seems to work nicely and is well balanced. The dice adds a bit of randomness to keep everyone on edge. Trading adds some interaction and collecting resources to spend adds satisfaction whilst your settlement grows. It has enough depth to keep players engaged whilst not too much that its hard to teach or off putting to beginners. A very nice social game IMO.|13|Catan

The game itself was an instant hit with my group, it has stayed a staple of my collection, and would probably be one of my games of choice should I try and introduce some other friends deeper into the hobby.  If you have friends that really love to haggle, this game can become a great source of laughs... or a nightmare, depending on your friends, haha.|13|Catan

9326|merichards|9.0|A modern classic, fantastic fun and the variability and two main routes to victory make for interesting and engaging games. Despite the replayability the rules and concept are straightforward enough that somebody that has never played this or any other 'Eurogame' will get involved and provided they didn't bungle the initial placement they stand a good chance of making a game of it. There's a balanced pre-placed layout in the rules that helps for the first game, it is pretty scripted for anybody who's familiar with the game though, whichever colour you get you'll know what you need to do at a glance - strictly for first games only.|13|Catan

9427|max_s|9.0|Trading mechanic makes this game evergreen classic. Despite having excitement via dice, the actual gameplay is pretty average and even dry by todays standards, but the trading makes the game much more lively! The rules are relatively simple at least for how deep game you get. It's deserving of its status as a classic eurogame that started it all. Still a good one, especially if you're introducing new people to modern boardgaming! Expansions.. meh.  2-Player Comment: * Settlers of Catan wasn't designed for two, but internet is full of variants to try (especially if you also own Seafarers). I prefer normal rules even for two myself, but play to 7 points only. It's no match to 3-4p game though and for most people some variant is a must.

First the board is horrible as are the cards, the artwork was dated in 1976 and the rules could use some variants. The expansions are a joke in that they DON'T REQUIRE CATAN TO PLAY. I want a real expansion, new resources, new cards, co-op play. I've seen Catan expansions with the last one, but this game is a play for awhile, keep on the back burner for newer players and pull this out every once in awhile for some epic (albeit old-school) gaming.  1995 ... old school. haha...|13|Catan

9718|brw12|9.0|"50 plays:  Such elegant design! So few choices, but ones that matter! Such good use of randomness! Such simple compensation for being behind! Such pressure and reason to negotiate! So many ways to win! Just a perfect game, satisfying nearly every time I've ever played. It's true that if you aren't good at it, you won't win... that's not the same as ""the player behind can't catch up"".  And nearly immune to analysis paralysis, because so few options are open each turn. It can get a bit stuck in complex negotiation proposals.  Trying to play this with eight-year-olds showed me Catan's flaws, however. When the dice do nothing for you for several rounds, the game can get frustrating and boring. My daughter actually burst into tears at one point because she was getting so many sheep, and nothing but sheep!  Another parent suggested playing with kids using two rules adjustments: 1. settlements and cities can be placed 1 space from each other (not just 2) 2. on the first turn, you earn resources from both your initial settlements  I'd add a third: 3. the robber only forces players with more than 7 cards to discard one card (to avoid the heartbreak of discarding half your hand)"|13|Catan

9770|jaredmason|9.0|This is the game that reinvented the board gaming  hobby, opening the eyes of the masses to the possibility that there was more to board games than Risk and Monopoly.  Settlers' popularity actually makes complete sense. The game is quite easy for new players to grasp giving it wide reach in terms of its potential audience. But what makes it really unique is that the game play appeals on so many different levels. Whether you like building stuff, or managing resources, or trading and negotiating, or rolling dice, or collecting sets, or building an economic engine... there really is something there for everyone to enjoy.  One of the real highlights for me is the free-trade mechanic, which I haven't seen much elsewhere. The economy self-regulates based on the availability of resources and stage of the game. Someone might pay you three resources for that brick now, but two minutes later its worthless! It's fun to figure out what kind of deals you can pull together each turn and it also keeps everyone constantly engaged.  Obviously the variability of the game is a huge plus. The hexes are laid out in a random order each game, the numbers which determine resource frequency will also change. You can try out different strategies by using development cards or ports. And there are some neat organic catch-up mechanics like the robber and negotiation, which mix things up and lead to many very close games.  I have played probably 200+ actual person to person games of Settlers and I still really enjoy it. These days I play it most often with the family or with newbies as there are better games for a truly strategic head to head. But nevertheless this is a versatile, elegant and highly repayable game - a must have for any collection.|13|Catan

9841|rrei|9.0|An almost perfect game. Mechanics are beautifully elegant, plays very quickly (40~60m with my group), negotiation makes the game very fun and interactive. The only downside is that randomness has too much impact on the game for my taste. I agree that the game should contain some randomness, but if it was more controlled, I would consider this a perfect board game. A great game nonetheless. Strongly recommend it for light gamers.|13|Catan

9843|crazycat04|9.0|The perfect game.  It is open-ended, encourages good negotiation skills, has a bit of luck, but also has an equally big strategic part to it. It succeeds on all levels of a board gaming experience and has very simple rules.  |13|Catan

Look, the split in 10 coin flips is unpredictable. Flip it 10,000 times, and it becomes extremely predictable. This game makes sure there are enough dice rolls for luck to even out.

10096|nashesq|9.0|Good game to play with family or group of boardgames and non-boardgamers. Random luck enough of a factor to allow newbies a chance to win with experienced players.  I  found game less enjoyable with expansions  and,  worse,  I lost the non-gamers who might have enjoyed it before  I  treasure the elegant simplicity of the base game.   Good negotiations aspect and some small bit of take that. As someone who grew up on diplomacy int 1970's, I would never introduce that to your players myself, because it can bring out the worst in people.  This game is far better in teaching a skill set to young players without teaching them the bad aspects of a game like diplomacy.   A hall of fame level game. A fixture in my top 10 and the  second oldest game deign among my top 10. |13|Catan

10262|spiffalski|9.0|"This game is ancient but we play it on the local game night when everyone has had a hard week and just wants a relaxing game. The game is easy to play so conversation flows as you play it. It is just a feel good game.   If you are playing a game like Caverna - a popular favourite at the game group - then everyone is thinking and the conversation pretty much goes out the window until the end.  As a family game Settlers (sorry, ""Catan"") is fantastic. I am a bit disappointed I had to splash out so much to get 5 player extension. This is why I have held off getting seafarers expansion because it is expensive with the 5 player extension."|13|Catan

10306|wallwaster|9.0|This game kind of got old, but it still works. There are no other game that does things this game does. Getting the income based on where you are and trading and all that just goes so well together. There is a minor take that element, but if people use it wisely, not just for revenge, it's a integral element of the game as the catch up mechanism and even though I usually hate this kind of stuff, it's not a big deal here, and it's so fast it doesn't really hurt. This and the hand limit is a constant pressure to use your resources as soon as you can which is great to keep the game just going fast and smooth.|13|Catan

[b]Pros:[/b] - Easy to learn, hard to master - You can learn main rules very fast (and search for more precise rules later) - Good variability: --- modular board --- different starting positions --- different tactics to win (you need to adapt to your position and cards) --- trading between players - Appropriate game length considering complexity  [b]Cons:[/b] - Boring for player who positioned their settlement unwisely on the start or have bad luck with dices. But these games are often much faster so the misery is over soon.  [b]Note:[/b] I'm still trying to measure luck involvment in this game. Currently I'm thinking about 50% luck / 50 % skill|13|Catan

But I play this game a few times a year with cities and knights and seafarers (the best way to play it) with my family, and I love every experience of it. A classic and has been my #1 game to get others into games. The marijuana of board games. |13|Catan

That's Ok the game goes fast.   Catan rekindled my interest in board gaming as I was sick of sitting around waiting for my turn, or falling behind in the score only to know I couldn't play another game for hours.   |13|Catan

10535|BabyAzerty|9.0|Great game to be played with friends & family (you can play it with a 12 yo kid, no problem).  It has an interesting replayability. The game mechanism is fairly simple:  You start with setting 2 cities on 2 ressources (on the board obviously), then it goes: - Throw the die - Collect ressources (everybody who has a building on the collectable ressources) - Trade with the other players if needed - Expand your roads, build a new city or buy a special card - Repeat until you win 12 victory points (by creating cities and having specific cards)  The good point of this game is that even if it is not your turn, you can partially play by collecting ressources.  And this is the strength of Catan: No one gets bored!|13|Catan

It has all the key feature of a great game  • infinite replayability  • player interaction (trading)  • multiple ways to win in case luck is working against you  • players are involved in each turn   • Anyone can win even a newcomer.   • very satisfying play - I'm always ready to play again.    This game gets played in our house. It may be the only game that everyone enjoys.  |13|Catan

10740|LostChord_Mark|9.0|much maligned of late - it is the game that introduced me to the hobby and holds up just fine 20 years down the road -- 3 players is optimal - 2 can be done with a lot of rules tweaking - and 4 just drags.  fun game - clear rules - multiple paths to victory - and you can have a beer/wine and chat about this and that whilst playing!|13|Catan

10742|JasonM76|9.0|An excellent gateway game for the hobby and a game we still break out a few times a year but especially anytime we have new people over that aren't 'boardgamers'.  The rules are simple and easy to pick up quickly and the sense of accomplishment at completing houses, cities and roads keeps people coming back.  The minimal direct conflict (except the Robber) keeps things on the tranquil side. 5-6 player expansions work well in a jam but ideally we stick to 4-players as it minimizes the down time (a killer for new players).|13|Catan

We always played two-player without any rules modifications and really enjoyed it.  It hasn't hit the table much lately, but we did try a two-player variant recently that I think played much better.

11230|beatlefreak84|9.0|An awesome game, and one I can definitely understand why it's called a modern classic!  Catan is a simple game to pick up, but has a great layer of strategy in terms of where to build to help you acquire resources, where to move the robber, and when to buy and play development cards.  You really can't stay out of each other's way in this game; if you want to win, you have to do some blocking and backstabbing, which makes the game a lot of fun.  My two slight knocks against the game are that the game is only for 3-4 players and requires hacks or expansions to do 2 or more than 4 players, and a blunder early on is typically so significant that, unless your opponents make a similar one, you will never recover and are just on a slow march to an inevitable loss.|13|Catan

11419|Siliconpaladin|9.0|"One of the classics that often introduce new players to a style of board game outside of the traditional American ""Milton Bradley"" games.  The type and feel of each game is very much dominated by the board set up and the personalities of the players.  Dice can dramatically swing the outcome of the game, so using the deck of cards instead of the dice can even out the distribution and help eliminate the ""bad luck"" component.  Personally, I feel that luck is a part of the game and figuring your way out of a crappy situation is part of the fun.  Great game to play again and again; and a great way to bring new players into Euro-style board games."|13|Catan

Tra le geniali idee che ne hanno decretato il successo planetario: le trattative per gli scambi di carte tra giocatori, la mappa componibile e sempre diversa, l’assenza di tempi morti in attesa del proprio turno. A lungo andare, può pesare la componente fortuna legata ai dadi, ma resta perfetto per i tornei: veloce e mai banale.|13|Catan

Well over a hundred I'm sure counting the times I've played with the seafarers and cities and knights expansions. Not to mention star trek catan as well. Some people grow tired of this game after a while and others like myself just don't. Either way, most people will end up playing this game many times because it holds a very high replay value. It's strategic enough to offer a challenge for more seasoned gamers but easy enough to teach the base game in just a few minutes. The expansions also hold great additional content if you find yourself looking for more variation. And the cities and knights expansion makes the game far more intricate. This will always be a game that I have in my collection.|13|Catan

I love that it has player interaction that leads to good laughs with the right players. The art does it purpose. You can play it a lot and it doesn't get old. You have to plan your towns very well or you'll be losing from the first turn. Add Catan to your collection, you won't regret it.|13|Catan

11606|sinkronize|9.0|Very good game in which you make your own strategy and can rarely get beaten by the dice roll. It happens but an experienced player almost all the time finds a way to the victory. Lots of replayability, competitive, a bit mean, can knock a player out from the first turns or even from the setup which can be a big downside while playing with slow friends a 2 hours game. Low replayability for the ones who dont get this right, and high for the others :)|13|Catan

11655|Lineron|9.0|One of my favorite games partly because it is the reason I entered the wonderful world of board gaming, and partly because it is a pretty darned good game.   I really enjoy the trading part of the game that gives a lot of interaction even without direct conflict. Multiple ways of scoring.   This was my go to game for introducing players to board gaming. They never really understood how to win the first game but almost everyone wanted to play again.  Now maybe ticket to ride would be better but that is a bit to easy\limited for me.   It doesn't get very much play anymore but when we do I always enjoy it.   Cons If you are tied down early it can be a boring stretch until finished.   House rule? If you roll a seven You move the robber. Makes it a lot more fun and do not double punish you for the roll. (Note that we had two different ways of handling the robber in the rules so this might be the original way of using him. If not make it so :)|13|Catan

Many expansions expand and continue to add to the game, but the base game is a staple in gaming.

I grew up playing classic American games (Monopoly, Stratego, Risk, etc.) and this was the first ""eurogame"" I played.  I played this game exclusively for a couple of years and then though ""if I have so much fun playing this, maybe there are other, even better games out there!""  Then I got Puerto Rico and the rest was history.  I played this again a few months ago for the first time in years and kind of hated it.  Just so random.

11896|KolonistenLover|9.0|Really simple and yet enjoyable game. Everyone starts with placing two villages on the board. These villages share borders with tiles of grain, wool and other raw materials. To get something from these tiles, you have to throw the numbers on these tiles with two dices. A little bit of luck is required. However, some numbers are more commonly thrown with two dices (6, 7, 8) then others (2 or 12), so the locations of your starting villages are important. You can use the raw materials to expand your two starting villages into a large network of villages and cities (which get you even more raw materials). Main goal is to first get to ten points (villages are 1 point, cities are worth 2).|13|Catan

11900|vicky313|9.0|Good game. I don't really like strategy because I don't like heavy thinking. So I basically lose every game.  But the group I play with have a lot of fun. It's more intense and perhaps fun with the expansion (Traders and Barbarians) and we hardly play it without the expansions, unless we are teaching a new person.|13|Catan

I have to rate it a 9, however, due to the quality of the boards - they warp far too much in even mildly humid climates. Still, it's hard to beat a good game of Catan among (soon-to-be-ex-) friends!|13|Catan

I feel that a 3 person game moves very nicely, but going up to 5-6 players (with the 5-6 player expansion) makes the game really drag out as everyone makes their decisions.   That said, I love playing this game, and find it very versatile for making up / playing new variations with just the base. My 9-year-old twin daughters grasp the game just fine and have even figured out good strategies on their own which have lead to wins|13|Catan

12405|DenjaGravis|9.0|One of the most played games in the modern age of board games, Settlers of Catan (or simply Catan) is a building and bartering game that has you trading with your opponents and collecting resources to build the roads, cities, and settlements to try to win the game. A modern day classic to many who have played it and a game that helped me get back into the world of board games, Catan is a board game I play at least once a year and is so popular that it's even sold at big name retailers like Walmart.  If you have yet to play or want to get someone back into the joy of playing board games, sit down and play Catan, you won't regret it.|13|Catan

12466|meeplesunite|9.0|I've rated Catan quite highly, because despite newer, flashier, more challenging games, it remains a classic in my collection. It's the perfect gateway game to introduce new gamers to the exciting world of modern boardgames.|13|Catan

12471|MajorAirfix|9.0|"Have only played this with kids 7-12 and its fun enough with them and probably with adults also.  Even though it's ""competitive,"" you are so focusing on building your town, it also seems more like you're ""competing with yourself."" Also the trading part seems cooperative.  One of the few games my wife likes (along with Memoir 44)."|13|Catan

12477|Chappy7|9.0|I've heard lots of hate, and lots of love for this game.  I grew up playing it, and although I now prefer less political and more strategic games, this will always be a great game to me.  It's my favorite trading game I've ever played by far.   One negative: I always played with my parents' copy, which was quite old.  Once it was thoroughly worn out, we had to update.  I have to say, the artwork in the new version is tacky and cartoonish.  Not good at all.  I really miss the old cards and tiles.|13|Catan

12488|acatnamedjoe|9.0|"Catan seems to get a lot of bad press, but I can't for the life of me figure out why, I think it's great.  It's got such good player interaction - its not just the quantity but also the type: all of the trading, blocking, and the robber  aspects of it create this ""screw you"" kind of atmosphere that always seems to create really good banter around the table.  It's a good game to play with a range of levels of experience of gamer. The randomness of the dice rolls takes away a lot of the potential for a more experienced player to just crush weaker players, and means that even when you're losing you feel like ""maybe in the next few turns several people will roll a 2, and my fortunes will change!""

12588|jmat82|9.0|Bel gioco, ottima interazione. si costruiscono strade,colonie che poi diventeranno città, e forniranno ai loro padroni, materiali in base al terreno dove si erigono. questi materiali si scambiano per costruire o per ottenere carte sviluppo, ogni costruzione fornisce punti,le carte sviluppo producono sia punti che benefit. Il ladro blocca la produzione e ruba materiali. Il mio secondo gioco, non disdegno mai una partita... ottimo per neofiti per via delle facili regole, ma gioco molto strategico.  1)  Tensione di gioco:             10 2)  Profondità:                    10 3)  Durata:                        10 4)  Facilità di gioco:             10 5)  Controllo sul gioco:           8 6)  Grafica ed illustrazioni:      6 7)  Tema & tematica Integrazione:  6 8)  Materiali:                     8 9)  Interazione:                   10 10) Rigiocabilità:                 10|13|Catan

12711|gogetter333|9.0|The game that got me into board gaming, and is still a favorite. Even though there is a significant luck factor to this game (which will likely turn off hardcore gamers), Catan should be in every board game collection.  The Epic Win ... Why I still love Catan: Nothing quite compares to being pathetically down-and-out ... written off as the player who has no chance ... wanting to blame the dice, but knowing you made some poor choices ... but then ... though a series of unpredictable events ... combined with reluctant alliances ... followed by a few key placements ... coupled with the correct physiological warfare pitting opponents against each other ... having the stars align just right .... like a flash in the night, you manage to pull 180 with a point shifting victory that nobody saw coming ... and all they can do is sit there - jaw dropped - wondering what just happened. That excited/nervous/poker-faced feeling for 15 rounds or so when you see how you might possibly win ... but know you probably won't ... and then somehow pulling it off ... priceless.

12789|Macklerz|9.0|"We finally found our own copy of Settlers of Catan after first playing it in WI years ago (circa 2004).  We used to have our own copy, but my sibling ""borrowed"" the game and never returned it.  You know the type, they keep games they borrow from you long enough that they believe they are actually ""their"" games.  Anyway, we found a bargain copy in the USED games section at Black & Read and we were lucky enough to discover it had the 5&6 player expansion in it.  Having local game stores that take in used games for store credit, and that sell bargain priced used games is amazing to have in our local community.    Introduced our 7 & 9 year old to it and they really liked it.  At one point our older son needed a resource and our youngest traded him 1:1 for what he needed.  We asked why he did it, ""he's my brother and I love him,"" was the answer.  A turn or so later the older boy returned the favor by using the Robber on his generous little brother.  The little guy said, ""but I traded with you.""  When the older boy insisted he was going to rob him anyway...the little guy said, ""No snuggles for you tonight!""  The boys both love this game and play with different strategies.  Our youngest likes to try to win with just two settlements, a port, and development cards and longest road and biggest army.  Mom loves building cities early.  Dad thinks he can trade his way to victory.  The oldest boy tries a different strategy every play, and is aways there a turn away from winning.   A family favorite for a reason."|13|Catan

Only flaw is if you get stuck with a bad board or trapped the game can have a lot of wasted turns.  Plus, someone almost always hoards a resource and gets the ire of the rest of the players.  Then again, that's also part of the fun.|13|Catan

13294|richcharters|8.96|"There's a reason it's a classic!  Stale?...I think not!  However, I do agree that the opening set-up can be a little too powerful in some games.  But if you find yourself in a less than ideal game setup then it's time to go for the upset of the century.  Also, don't forget to trade.  This game is about trading.  If you refuse to trade because you don't want to help anyone then it's not really within the spirit of the game, IMO.  If you play that way, I could see why that game (and many games) would not be desirable for you.  The good part about Settlers is the excitement associated with each role of the dice....everyone is interested in the outcome.  Half will yell:  ""yeah!!!""  and half will yell:  ""Noooo!!!""     It's just fun."|13|Catan

13299|Ninokid|8.903|A trading game that is very fun to play, the robber can be a bit dull, but after reading online a good variant may be to not take a card from someone else when rolling a 7, but perhaps get to take a card that you would like from the bank.  That rule alone takes out exactly what is problematic with the game and the back-stabby nature of that rule. Otherwise, the game is fun, not too long, but also it is something that can be played with anyone as it's easy to explain.|13|Catan

You collect resources (wool, lumber, brick,ore, and wheat) to trade them in to build things, namely roads, settlements or cities.  You get points for the builings, first to 10 wins.

13402|EMSQUARED2013|8.8|Catan is a classic. I don't even need to review this game because everyone has played this game and if you haven't, you actually have and just don't remember that it was called Catan. There are a handful of go-to games out there for me that are easy setup, light-medium weight for chill nights or straight gateway games for new players or people who hate board games because they hate monopoly. This game is very rewarding each time the dice rolls that one resource you have been waiting for the whole game but also extremely punishing if you did not position yourself for success. There is definitely possibility and even probability for a runaway player who just absolutely dominates the round. Also, players positioned poorly will be punished relentlessly for about an hour and have to watch other players accomplish everything they need and more.|13|Catan

13407|N0DramaLlama|8.8|One of the very first board games I got, and still love. Even though this is a dice rolling game I find strategy always trumps luck over the course of the game. I love the game mechanisms and find they encourage the table to talk and everyone always seems to have fun playing. I also really like that 95% of the score is visible based on what you've built on the board, this allows people to stop the leader from running away with the game by ganging up on them, but there's always another threat looming so there's almost a social deception element as you need to bluff about your strength sometimes to encourage the table to gang up on someone else while you push forward with your plans. Can't recommend Catan, The Seafarers expansion, and 5-6 versions of each highly enough.|13|Catan

In regards to gameplay, it's an excellent game that utilizes dice rolling probability, hand management, resource gathering, and network building all very well. Difficulty is low and will forever be an enjoyable classic strategy game for any experience level. Recommended Players: 4.|13|Catan

13432|FranklinTV|8.741|"Fabulous game that probably cemented my interest in Eurogames.  Probably more luck than you think, but a really nice game.    ""We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time"". T S. Eliot.  This quote reminds me of Settlers.  You buy it as a gateway game, go mad buying so many other games that you take it a bit for granted, but when you come back to Settlers after a break, you are reminded again that is it simply a brilliant piece of boardgaming (18/12/08 - Rating 9). UPDATE: Push to ten in that it is the cornerstone game for me (5/4/10 - Rating 10). UPDATE: This is still a very enjoyable game (and still a 10) (24/11/12). UPDATE: My new rating system is to 3 decimal places, so that when I eventually rate every game, I can do a top 100.  This is still a brilliant game, which for me is still an enjoyable experience.  So, the 3 decimal places, I rate is a 9.728 (Dec 2015). UPDATE: Maybe familiarity does breed contempt for my views now on Catan?  I still really like the game / series, but there are now for me better board gaming experiences I would rather go to.  Still rightly a classic, but I think I have reach a point where nothing is left to surprise or further delight me with this game (Rating 8.741, Feb 17)."|13|Catan

WAS THERE EVER... it was cool because we just used the internet version to facilitate our gameplay... everything else stayed the same, but we were able to instantly have a new map and new scenarios... somthing that would take 10+ minutes in person (also there was realtime scoring)  in addition to that, the internet community had the cities and knights expansion built in (1st time seeing that)...which i enjoy FAR more...  so after ""discovering"" catan online, we all became closet catan players... i would literally play catan for 12 hours straight always playing ""just one more game"" the difference about playing online is that trading is so less personal, and that it become just another function.... games go extreemly fast, and everyone you play against has a great understanding for the tactics... I developed extreemly good tactics this way, but eventually I overdosed.    I can still play catan, but now that i understand it so well, it's not as fun for me to play... everything seems too ""random""  I highly recomend this game for anyone that hasn't OD'd on it... please play it in person a few time first though, The internet community is BRUTAL for people who are ""slow"" or inexperienced  "|13|Catan

13518|Zellmo|8.6|Quick to learn simple game.  Not much going on with it and just the right amount of luck to have things turn around or give someone who isn't as good a chance.  My biggest complaint would be the opening setup is far more important than the rest of the game.  Could use some balance making later decisions mean a little more so a bad start doesn't need to rely to much on luck to claw your way back.  Games go quick enough though when that does happen to fix your mistakes in the next game.  Overall a great game that most people will enjoy.|13|Catan

But the forward/reverse starting setup rule, and the wheeling and dealing of the trades more than make up for it. I still think it's a great game, but I just don't play it very often any more -- hence the slight drop in rating.  I wouldn't introduce euros to a total newbie with Settlers, without a lot of hand-holding: they'd get slaughtered if they didn't understand the importance of the starting set up, and trades later on as people get within striking range of the magic 10. But it's a classic for a reason! These days, though, I prefer it's descendants (e.g., Cities and Knights, America, etc.). |13|Catan

The trading also keeps you involved, even when it's not your turn.  If you play often enough and for long enough, the luck tends to even out, and its a matter making good decisions.  I like that between the longest road, the robber baron, and special development cards, the lead can go back and forth, and someone can come from out of nowhere for the win.|13|Catan

Another option is to [thread=134095]roll three dice[/thread] and pick two.  Game play can also be improved and made more even with the Event cards.

Here's a website that creates `balanced maps' for starting resources, and is even used in some tournaments: [url=http://bettersettlers.com/]bettersettlers.com[/url].  Also owned:  [gameid=2807] - Base game add-on for playing with five to six players.  As much fun as the base game with three to four players. [gameid=20038] - Potential to improve Settlers by eliminating some randomness and adding some strategy and events.  The Earthquake event can be a bit harsh early in the game though, so we've ignored that.  Overall, it seems to improve the game and make it more balanced.

13774|PThron|8.5|This is a game that strikes a nice balance of strategy and luck, and its pleasures and nuances become greater with every play. The luck factor needs to be absorbed since a long run of bad rolls can beat you down and create some very cranky players, but most bad luck balances out over several plays. I think this game deserves every accolade it has received and even writing about it now makes me want to play. This is a great game.  Update: After a couple of years of playing this seminal game, I stand by my original assessment. There are other games that have come after which I would often prefer to play now, but the fact is it remains the most requested and often-played game in my family. It also remains the most contentious, as the luck factor seems to make everyone rather edgy at least once during any given game. Still, it is often the go-to game on a night when everyone just wants to sit down and play something quickly. |13|Catan

13840|mildthrill|8.5|Game in a Nutshell: Players compete to settle and secure the best spots on a modular island. Roll dice to collect goods, trade with other players and spend to expand.  Played as: 3,4 player  Played with: Seafarers, Cities and Knights, 5-6 Player Expansion, and Plain  Pros: Good mix of luck, area control, player interaction and replayability make for an excellent, addictive game. Serves as an excellent gateway because of enough familiar mechanics combined with some fresh innovative ideas.   Cons: It can be luck driven for players of equal experience. It's not unusual to see a person who benefits from some lucky roles early on have a sizable advantage as the game progresses.  Other: If you're reading this and haven't yet played it yourself, do yourself a favor and change that. It got me hooked to euros and more then a few people have gone out and bought it after just one game of me introducing it to them. However, having played this so much, I'd almost prefer playing any other game over this one given the choice. That still doesn't stop me from giving it big props for what this game has meant to the gaming community at large.  Best Use: One of the first gateway games people should be thinking of introducing the 'is it like monopoly?' crowd to.|13|Catan

He has come fairly close, but either me or Phillip end up edging ahead.  He may not be able to strategize with flexibility like we can.  His goals for winning seem to be one-track and he gives up if he can't accomplish his set goals.|13|Catan

13935|mtgjudge|8.5|Archetypal euro-game with more decision-making/strategy than the other pillar of the industry, Carcassonne.  A tad of randomness keeps it interesting, although wiley traders will bubble to the top.  I've rated it so high because of it's veratility in audience:  this would be a hit with a quartet of game newbies or seasoned strategists.  As long as the skill levels of the players are similar, the game will always be competitive.|13|Catan

There is a lot of race tension, can go really quick, and more interaction than most other games we play. Yeah, it seems light compared to lots of other games, but to me, it really has a great balance of *fun* and competition. The only real problem gamers have with this game is that it's been overplayed. And so many gamers are allergic to dice.   Still, I continue to be amazed at how much non-gamers love this and are willing to play this above any other Euro. Simple as this game may ultimately be, it sure captures the essence of gaming in a non-threatening way.|13|Catan

The thief's presence blocking a good resource tile has turned out to be the far greater threat than the card he steals.  The only trouble is that it's a bit finicky with 2 players, so we don't get to play it that often.  And there are so many exciting games to play when we have enough people, this one doesn't get the attention it deserves."|13|Catan

This truly opened up the horizon for them and since then, I have introduced many more games that went over really well.

14257|mike513|8.5|Great game to play with everybody!  Build towns, get resources and be the first to get 10 points. Each game is different, and you will need a bit of luck to get your resources, but if you play well you can manage to win.  It only has one drawback: If you don't know where to build the first towns you can make a bad decisition and the rest of the game will be boring and frustrating. So it's very important to help new players in this step.|13|Catan

14263|spades8|8.5|This was my gateway game as an adult back into the boardgaming world.  People complain of randomness but I don't mind it at all.  To me it's part of the game. Like in Monopoly if you don't get your rolls you're not going to get Park Place and Boardwalk.  However, there is so much more here in terms of strategy and different paths to victory.  It's a great gateway game and a very fun game which is the most important point above all other criteria when evaluating a game for yourself, whether you're into strictly highly strategic games with no luck or a newbie who loves high change light games.  For me, this is a great family fun game in the Medium to Light category, played in about an hour and we always have fun playing it. There's a bit of player interaction with the robber (you can choose to gang up on the leading player to an extent), and trading cards with others, creating longest road or largest army and stealing the points from the current leader, or blocking opponents paths with your roads.  Haven't had a chance to add the expansions which I think would allow one to tailor the game and make it even better for them and longer.  As you can tell from the way it exploded in North America as a gateway game it appeals to a higher percentage of the population and non-gaming people than most other games. Some people just don't want or can't handle too complicated and strategic a game.  They want it medium/light for a reason - to relax and have fun and Catan hits the spot extremely well!  I'll always remember it as the game that got me back in...and Love It!|13|Catan
14264|jeffthezero|8.5|Preferable due to length of play and easier/more inviting for casual players than some similar games.  I find that eventually it only seems preferred with 4 people, despite it working decent with 3, there are other games I'd rather play with 3.  Settlers is a game I need to be in the mood for, but when the mood strikes, it's always a good choice.|13|Catan

The dice are a double edged sword; On the one hand, the randomness and the flow of the game puts more focus on the actual trading and less on just having a full proof strategy, but it can also put you in a position you can never recover from.  This is a great game, but I can see it being frustrating to play if you over play it and find yourself the victim of poor dice rolls and the robber.|13|Catan

14457|Sarahliznic|8.5|"26th Birthday from Sarah & Matt  We first played this game at our friend Rich's house as 3 couples. We were all new players although had heard of it because of the TV show The Big Bang Theory ""I need wood"".  As a party game with lots of people fighting for resources and to build as quickly as possible we had great fun and raved about it to other friends.  So quite unexpectedly on my my birthday the friends I had raved about it too had bought it for me. We've played this many more times than I have recorded and still love haw tactical you have to be to scoop a win from under your opponents noses many times it has come down to the final roll.  I've just purchased the first add on for this game seafarers so I'm looking forward to adding an extra dimension to the game."|13|Catan

14549|TimThree|8.5|This is a great game system and an essential for any collection.  20 years after its release, it is still a fantastic gateway game, and I often have friends that don't play board games asking to play.  There is a reason why this game has been able to break in to the American market when so many others have failed; it implements mechanics that most haven't seen in games (resource management, trading, engine building) in an extremely elegant and simple way.  The game is perhaps too simple and luck-reliant to have longevity for a lot of hobby gamers (the expansions do help with this problem), but it is worthy of the popularity that it has.|13|Catan

14589|Cobbs|8.5|Random resource generation? Eh, not really. You take control of nodes as a gambled investment on gaining resources. You always know the odds something will be rolled, so it's a very economic bidding game in this way.   That's why it's balanced - it's for repeated plays. Play this with the same group and it won't matter if you go 2 games in a row not getting many resources, because the next 2 games may play out much different. And the routes to victory (especially in expansions) becomes so fleshed out that maximum resource generation isn't as required.   ---   Has so many mechanics within. Games that have better mechanics also sacrifice elements that Catan weaves together. A strong game. You can play it if you're in the mood for trading, building things from resources, area control, and so on. Not many games can give you that.  The variety of gameplay in settlers makes it a game most gaming groups won't be too worried to play, because whatever gaming mood they are in, it's likely Catan will give them what they want. And if their gaming mood changes next week, Catan may still have what they want. At least a little bit of it.   That makes this game continually hit the table. It's one we usually are cool with playing no matter what mood we're in, because it has a little bit of something for every mood. Not many games can do that.|13|Catan

14649|frolfergolfer|8.5|"Not your usual board game (Sorry, Clue, Monopoly) in that you don't have a token that you move around a board the number of spaces rolled on the dice. The ""board"" in this game is made up of hexagon tiles of 5 different resources that are randomly placed in a honeycomb and randomly assigned a number between 2 and 12. The ability to change the layout of the board allows for countless replay-ability. A great game for people looking to branch out from the standard board games, but I imagine it would be a little overwhelming to grasp the rules by simply reading the rule book included, it would be best to find someone with experience to teach you the game."|13|Catan

14773|Gonzimba|8.5|Para mí Catan es un juego que toda persona debería jugar en algún momento, como que quiebra lo que todos pensarían de un juego de mesa, tiene demasiada interacción con las personas que lo están jugando, lo cual lo hace muy divertido. Es fácil de jugar para divertirse, pero es muy complejo para poder jugarlo de mejor manera, existen muchos tipos de estrategia y uno puede darle muchas vueltas al juego pensando cuál será la mejor colocación para cada uno de los mapas que se puede formar.  Este juego cuenta con campeonatos nacionales en Chile, por lo que se puede jugar de manera competitiva, entregando una motivación extra a la hora de jugarlo.|13|Catan

14835|jords26|8.5|The game that introduced me to this wonderful hobby, it remains a firm favourite. At the time I thought it was the best game ever and while that is almost certainly not the case, we always have a great time whenever it hits the table and would probably play it a lot more if it played at 2 players (thank you Catan Rivals!). My only reservation is that more often than not, especially at 4 players, there is at least one player who finds themselves cut off quite early on and being that player can be a bit of a grind - its not always the quickest game! When the dice aren't going your way it can be incredibly frustrating but the reverse is also true. I would subscribe to the view that better games involve less luck but, for me, there will always be a space in my collection for this fantastic game.  |13|Catan

15005|sailingsteve434|8.5|Destined to be remembered as the classic that launched the table top renaissance in the midst of the digital age. I know that sounds sappy, but this game is legend for a reason. The shine only dulls due to comparison to the new awesomeness being developed these days. Still worth taking it off the shelf at least a few times a year just to argue over what constitutes a reasonable exchange rate of wool to ore.|13|Catan

15066|Lindsey|8.4|A top-notch game of building and development.  Of the 20(ish) people I’ve introduced this to, every single one has enjoyed it, and many have become real fans.  I’d suggest playing with resources face up when teaching people, since that will reduce the frustration of learning exactly what you need to build what.  The game is simple, yet it manages to have realistic production, trade, and building.  The ending is usually either very close, or such a blowout that it ends very quickly.|13|Catan

Start with two towns and roads with limited resources, expand your roads, build more towns and upgrade to cities to accrue more resources on each random resource roll.  Interact with other players to trade resources.  For me, this game was best with the knights and cities upgrade.|13|Catan

I will always want to play this, although now that I have played this so much (before logging games began) and have newer games, the rating has dropped from the original 10, but only because we don't play it so often anymore.  It is still a fantastic game. |13|Catan

15145|mgranese|8.3|This one of those games you can come back to time and time again! Simple game-play mechanics means it caters to gamers and non-gamers alike - but it still has enough depth of play to keep it interesting. Great player interaction as you jostle for space and resources. The open barter system for resources (where players can openly exchange resources) and quick turns means there is little down time and you're are consistently engaged through-out the game. Definitely worth getting the Seafarers expansion to add a bit more complexity!|13|Catan

Decisions on road, settlement and city placement are never easy.|13|Catan

Usually, we like to play it with the seafarer expansion set the most.  The first few times that I played this, I found it really boring!!!  After playing it with other beginners, I began to ""get it"" more and really started to enjoy it.  Now, I love it.  Since we originally purchased it, we have bought just about every expansion set out there... official and unofficial.  It is such an addictive, fun game.  One thing that we changed though, was we bought 12 sided dice, which evens out the chances of numbers being played.  I enjoy playing this game much more with expansions than the stand alone game."|13|Catan

15283|Nostradamus71|8.2|"[b]Settlers of Catan[/b] - Slovenian Edition (3rd 2007)  2-4 players (5-6 with expansion)  Has seen countless plays. Great game. I suppose my opinion might not last forever, its sheen may dull, but when? If one plays too often? It has been fun on a consistent basis, and am almost always willing to play it, which I cannot say for all games.  [b]The Pros[/b] -lots of player interaction due to negotiation/diplomacy/trading  -usually little down time (use a timer when playing with slow players!) -opponents' plans can be disrupted in various ways -multiple paths to victory -multiple game variants (expansions) -modular board =every game will be different -very easy to learn -not an overlong game, allowing 2 or more games to be played in one game night evening  [b]The Cons[/b] Some might complain about the usage of dice. If dice are not your thing, you could use a [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/20038/catan-event-cards]dice deck[/url] to replace them. It is included within the event cards in [thing=27760][/thing].  However, I think luck usually doesn't play a major role. The ""randomness"" of the dice roll doesn't automatically mean luck rules this particular game.  For one, the usage of two dice lessens the randomness, making some number totals more statistically probable than other totals (ex. totals of six are much more probable than totals of two, because there are more possible combinations of the dice rolls. Whereas 3 and 3, 1 and 5, 4 and 2 all equal 6, only 1 and 1 equal 2). See: http://wizardofodds.com/gambling/dice/  As you gain experience, you learn to avoid building on those provinces, which will statistically provide less resources. A frequent mistake committed by novices. And if the best provinces have already been taken during the initial setup, an experienced player knows how to use the sea ports to his advantage (exchanging resources 2:1 or 3:1).  Even if one player does indeed have more luck with the dice, and beats the statistic probability overwhelmingly, this usually tends to balance itself out: 1) with the other players creating alliances against him, 2) with the brilliant Robber mechanism, which steals from those too rich with resources, 3) the clever usage of sea ports, and 4) trading with your allies as much as possible. The key is to make those trades, which benefit you more than your opponent.  A degree of randomness challenges one's ability in adapting to changing circumstances. Real life is all about this. But for those who do not like it, there are always the dice cards mentioned above.  Whereas strategy is the overall plan, tactics are the actual means used to gain an objective. This game has both. But of course this is not one of the heavy, deep or complex games, which I do like as well.

The game says it's an hour long but our first couple plays have gone over 1 1/2 but that may be due to lack of knowledge of the rules. (Updated the rating from 9 to 8.2 due to game length not really changing. Tends to drag on at times though still a enjoyable game overall. Really like to play it, but not a game I would play on a weekly basis 6/9/2014)|13|Catan

Because I realize the luck involved (and that luck going against me so many times) is too dependent.   ""I can't believe this 8 is being rolled every time and not that 6 I need.""  Update: At least the last 5 games I've played, I get screwed the same way. Dice I need are never rolled and, can't get resources. People keep blocking me in. Grateful for this game being an intro to better games for me, but my estimation of Catan only keeps going down unfortunately."|13|Catan

This games makes you manage the luck factor by playing strategically (by deciding where to build, where to expand, which resources to trade). The trading aspect of resouces makes it a very social game as well.  To preserve it well, I also have a luxury wooden case which also contains Seafares en Cities & Knights of Catan.|13|Catan

After a few game sessions my youngest son (currently 15 years old) became extremely frustrated with several series of extremely bad rolls of the dice.  We had read about the variation of using a deck of dice instead, so we tried that.  He has now declared that in the future he will only play Settlers with a deck of dice, thus insuring a uniform probability distribution.|13|Catan

15570|JemyM|8.0|Settlers is an unique game, and is worthy a spot in every home as one of the best games ever made. I personally recomend it together with Cities &amp; Knights. Some prefer Seafarers. Its a matter of simplicity vs depth where C&amp;K have the Depth and Seafarers keep the simplicity of the original. The 5-6 player expansions is a &quot;must have&quot; if you have enough friends. |13|Catan
15571|Al Johnson|8.0|Very good game - dice adds a good random element, yet strategy more often than not wins in this game.  Random board is a cool feature.  Sometimes it can drag on a little long, and that&#039;s why I will have to limit it to an 8.  Unlike some games, I am glad this one is over when I&#039;m done because near the end it is kind of predictable.  Maybe also because I&#039;ve played it so much, it&#039;s gotten kind of old.|13|Catan

I think it&#039;s the new &quot;Monopoly&quot;-game for the family - easy to learn and fun to play (over and over again). The other thing which is cool about the game is the trading.

The biggest flaw I find is the randomness of the game, which doesn't become evident until the end of the game.  I haven't played it enough to isolate when it happens but after settlements have been upgraded to cities, the player with the best rolls (and positions) clearly pulls ahead.  The other players can only hope for 7's to activate the robber.  Overall, a highly enjoyable game. It clearly deserves its popularity.|13|Catan

It becomes more challenging with more players--however, the potential for getting ""locked in"" to one corner of the board also increases. "|13|Catan

16010|Steel Phoenix|8.0|This is a great game for all those people out there who think Risk and Monopoly are good games. It will show them the error of their ways and open their eyes to the beauty of the non-department store games. Settlers is colorful, easy to learn, and most importantly; random. The pieces are layed down in random fashion, then the number tiles and ports are randomly applied. Players then choose their starting positions and begin rolling the dice. The game has some minor balance issues, but the only great fault I have found, is that if a player has a run of bad luck early in the game it can leave them hopelessly behind, and trod upon by their fellow gamers. Less mature gamers often want to give up part way through when it is clear they are not going to win. The Seafarers expansion was weak, but the Cities and Knights expansion, while a bit complex, is a nice addition once the original has lost some luster. Not my favorite game, but it will have a place near the top of my game stack for many years to come.|13|Catan

16219|kevinfelker42|8.0|"12/04 (This is my initial review, which differs greatly from my new review below.  Just goes to show how group morale plays in a gaming experience)  Eh? That was it...how boring.  I thought this game was going to be AMAZING. Maybe it's the fact that the 4 players wanted to keep turning their head to America's Funniest Home Videos playing in the background.  Regardless: roll the dice (hope it's yours), collect resource, trade, build.  Repeate ad nauseaum.  This was not my first ""German"" game, but I have to say the lack of conflict (long time Magic:TG player) bored me.  I hated the 2-player Settlers card game as well.  Perhaps I would appreciate Teuber's Lowenherz/Domaine more.  I'm going to keep this I guess just to have, but I will probably sell the 2 expansions I bought for it.  I know the Cities & Knights expansion adds more conflict, but why bother when there are so many other games that do it without expansion. ===================================================== 12/7/06 (this is an updated review of the game, my previous experience with Settlers was dreadful.  I  knew my first try didn't fairly give the game a chance and requested to play it again 2 years later)  Finally got a chance to play a real game of Settlers and I enjoyed it.  There are multiple strategies to win (do you keep getting Production cards getting random VPs or perhaps the largest army having control over the robber and shutting down your opponents supply, or try to have the largest civilization netting you more supply, maybe picking up the longest road along the way).  We had a fun time with trade too, but if you're in short supply of a particular resource and people see you're winning, expect to have a trade embargo put on you (unless they're just that desparate).  That was my only negative experience in the game, because I had a boring 3 rounds where no one would help me and I had to do some inefficient trades with my port and watch them all catch up, and suddenly they were all against each other since I wasn't king of the hill anymore.  As the board fills up, lessening available real estate, trade becomes increasingly dominant as people compete for resources to upgrade settlements to cities.  Have you positioned yourself to control that supply?  Or did you choose another path to victory, silently waiting to reveal your Production Cards for VPs?  Are you shutting down that supply with your soldiers?  Is someone trying to steal ""Longest Road"" from you, racing you or trying to cut yours off?  This kind of nail-biting tension occurs at the end.  When I was finished playing, I was still thinking about the game and what I could have done better."|13|Catan

16370|jcbpereira|8.0|I was introduced to the game a few years ago by a very good friend of mine.

16458|sedjtroll|8.0|It's like a mature version of Monopoly. People have complained about the die rolling, but I have no problem with it. Getting screwed by a die roll only really affects you if you only play the game once, or once in a long while. When you like a game and play it frequently, then it's no big deal if you lose 1 game to a bad die roll.   Quite frankly, it should take more than just a couple bad die rolls to lose a winning game... people who say they lost to bad rolls probably weren't going to win anyway.  11/12/07: It's been quite some time now since I fully agreed with the above statement. After playing a lot more eurogames, I have gotten way too sick of the frustration associated with being on the 5, 6, 8, and 9 and still not getting resources all game.|13|Catan

16664|pusboyau|8.0|"*Generally in most game designs players will know well before their last turn where they stand (unless vps are kept secret such as in E & T) so robs most of the players of the excitement.I think one main reason why Settlers does it for me is that there are a few elements which makes the game less likely to be anti-climatic than any game design I have played before or since.   Resource holdings are secret, so there is tense uncertainty (unless you have memorised the transactions) whether other players will overtake you in the vp race, which incidently is kept at a simple and visual level.  But the clincher is the dice which in their nature provides hopeful swings in fortune or devasting schaudenfreude. The use of the commonly rolled ""7"" has been used to great effect to put risk filled fear in the leader from hoarding and also the robber as another mechanic to try and level the playing field, in a thematic way.   So the tension of declaring the 10th vp is often in doubt until the right resource is secured in a trade, the vp development card is drawn or worse you have accummalated more than 7 resources and fingers crossed no-one even yourself that a 7 is rolled. The development costs menu means that an internalised narrative of needs is established cranking up the climax. "|13|Catan

I think the reason why it's a great gateway game is because at the start of each turn your options for your next move are usually very clear and it's just a matter of choosing one or the other and pressing your luck. New players pick up on this quickly and it gives what some might call the ""illusion of strategy"" without making the game feel completely luck based.

16830|Beowulf|8.0|"[b]Spiel des Jahres 1995[/b] [b]Deutscher Spiele Preis 1995[/b]  [i]Posted: 10/2/04, Rated: 9[/i]  [i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] focuses on colony building and trading. There is no combat element to be found anywhere in this game, although a player can be a bit ruthless with the placement of the ""bandit"" piece. This lack of simulated armed conflict makes [i]Settlers[/i] an easy game to recommend for children.   The game board can be randomly created, which definitely adds to the game's replayability. Interaction between players is essential to winning this game -- another plus. Lastly, the resources are represented by cards, so there aren't any complex money transactions that would require a calculator to compute.   [i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] offers innovative gameplay, is easy to understand, does not attempt to model violent conflicts, and above all is fun to play. I am looking forward to introducing many of my friends to this great game.  [i]Updated: 4/22/06, Rated: 8[/i]  [i]The Settlers of Catan[/i] was one of the first ""Eurogames"" that I played.  Since that time, I've developed a bit more perspective.  I still really like it, but it has lost some of its luster.  On your turn, a bad roll can benefit your opponents more than yourself.  Enough of those rolls, and the other players can prevent you from developing (with 3 or four players).  Trading in desperation just makes matters worse.  If this scenario happens to you, you're effectively removed from contention, sometimes very early in the game."|13|Catan

16854|Melsana|8.0|Played 22 times. Last play was May 3, 2008.  This was fun.  It was enough different from Settlers of Cannan that I don't mind having both in my collection even though the primary reason we got this was to play with the 5-6 player expansion.  The close quarters and more evenly distibuted numbers really makes this game harder, and seems to suffer from a run-away leader problem that I didn't notice in Settlers of Cannan.  The last game we played was the first really close game - but that was because my husband didn't choose to win when he had the opportuntity and then gave me the exact trade I needed to get three points at once.  Just played the game with 3 players and it was a much closer game than when we play with 4.  I've decided I just don't like this game with 4 players.  There just isn't enough realestate and tempers get raised when one player out races another player to that critical corner.  There always seems to be one player that just doesn't have a chance.  Next time we play with 4 we are going to try and use the map for the 5-6 player expansion and see how that works. (This was just confirmed again in last nights game of cities and knights - and I was the player with NO chance.)  We just played a 4 player game of Cities and Knights and used the expansion tiles and it was a much more even game.  We didn't have as much running out of space issues and there wasn't ever a run-away leader.  But ther was still penty of tension.|13|Catan

16893|Friendless|8.0|Settlers is good because you can generally achieve something, and you usually feel like you're making progress. However there are periods of depression where the thief is on you or the dice aren't going your way that make you feel like you'll never get out of the quagmire you're in. It gets a slightly lower than deserved score from me because of the depression factor.|13|Catan
16894|deaf mute|8.0|If it was not for the fact that this game has been played in to the ground in the past, I would have rated it a 9. It stands as my first experience with European boardgames, back in 95. Wow, it still holds its own after ten plus years on the shelf. The game play is clean and simply elegent. I never did get into the expansions. We tried a few, and they just seemed to dilute its greatness. I recommend this game to any noob.  I do not recommend this game to a group  of six people using an expansion while several members look for excuses to get drunk.|13|Catan

If I am introducing some one to euro games for the first time, this is the one that I use and the game that hooks 'em all.  CONS: can get a bit repetative after several plays - buy some expansions. Players get the opportunity to amass resouces and build. This is where its capacity for further play ends. Strategies are limited.  Pros: While strategies are limited, because the game is an excellent blend of luck AND strategy, the game play is still somewhat fresh with each game. This one is a classic and it should be the law that every gamer owns a copy. :)|13|Catan

This game has spead like wildfire through my circle of friends and it's actually humorous to find out the people who now play Settlers because I introduced a friend to Settlers, who introduced another friend to Settlers, who introduced another friend to Settlers, etc. For all that I've played it, I still enjoy the experience - though I'd often rather play something else.

Fortunately, it's still complete and in surprisingly good shape (worn, but not unplayably so).  As with many other gamers of my generation, this was the first German board game that I played.  I still enjoy it quite a bit, but since I've overplayed it to some extent, I don't like playing it more than once a month or so.  This 8 rating is more historic than anything else, at least at this time.  I found a copy of someone's math problem set in the box (ACM95, for friends reading this to whom that might have meaning).  It was there for at least 2 years before I found it.  I hope the guy didn't have to redo the whole homework set.|13|Catan

16990|garysax|8.0|Dunno what to say about Settlers that hasn't been said.  It's pretty easy to pick up but meatier and more interesting than, say, Carcassonne for me (if not as interesting to look at on the table...).  I enjoy playing Settlers quite a bit and it still got one of the most positive receptions among my lighter euro group friends I've played with.  I think, as some of the ATers have pointed out in the past, the attractive thing about the game is that it's a design that crosses a lot of boundaries.  There is trading and building with victory points but it also has a number of screwage elements like the robber and has some randomness in the design.

17015|scriptorum|8.0|"I'm not saying anything new when I call this game a classic. I like to play with a random hex and number setup. The game is easy to setup and play, and offers quite a bit of strategic depth. Dice adds a little luck to the mix, but only over the short term. How do I maximize my resources? Should I compete for the biggest army or biggest road bonuses? UPDATE: Dropping my rating from 10 to 8.5, since there are so many other games I'd rather bring to the table before this. Still a great game.  UPDATE Jul-12-2010: Dropping it solidly to an 8, since this game fails the ""always want to play it"" test. Also, I think I was mad to say the game has only a ""little luck."" The game often never gets to the ""long term"" for the resources to even out -- it's only played to 10 points.  I really need to get a newer edition of this game. The '96 Mayfair edition has some visual design issues that make it difficult for new players to tell the resources apart. Specifically, A. the hexes and cards are all photographs (and dark, at that) and B. there are different images for the terrain (e.g., forest hex) and the resource (e.g., timber). The resource is illustrated as a circle. The player aid shows the resource circles only, and of course the hexes just show the terrain, but the resource cards have both. I was aiming for a conversion of an older player into a gamer, but instead I turned him off to ""complicated"" games such as this. :("|13|Catan

17070|Thies|8.0|Obviously a classic.  The game that got me (and many others) back into gaming.  Although I somewhat burned out on it, I still enjoy coming back to it occasionally.  4 players is far superior to 3, as it is much tighter and more competitive.  Ratings by number of players: 3 players: 6 4 players: 8  Really, I should rate this down when compared to my other ratings.  But it still gets at least a 1 point boost for nostalgia factor and overall impact on gaming (in gerneral and for me specifically).|13|Catan

17183|Vader78|8.0|Rated after 23 confirmed games with different opponents. In first games there was lots of interaction between players, but later the interaction level drops down when players don't try to propose every possible trade. In the end, when players have more or less experience, the interaction between players is quite scarce. A good game in good company, but the benefit of experience means this is not a game I would like to introduce to new players.  Randomness in the setup means that this game is very playable for long time. Unfortunately my latest games have used the beginners' setup.  Updated after 24th and 25th plays, introducing the game to new beginners despite the comment above. After all, this is a classic game everyone should know. Let's say, I won't introduce this one to non-players very easily. :) Updated the rating from 7 to 8. Now three plays of Catan on three consecutive Tuesdays, but still without expansions...  I have several small expansions for this game, looking forward to try them sometime, when there are no beginners around.|13|Catan

The rest of the game plays out pretty automatically and is just there to resolve who played the best in the placement phase. Still, I like it.|13|Catan

Play this and you may never play monopoly and its like again.  The Seafarers expansion is enjoyable and easy to add on. The cities and knights expansion has a ton of rules, adding to an already large set, and is not recommended for the not-so-serious gamer group.   The 5-6 player expansions are nice because they allow for a bigger party, but the game tends to slow down too much for our tastes with the higher number of players. It seems like eons between turns. I would recommend keeping it to 3 or 4 players.|13|Catan

This is a solid game that makes for a decent, but slightly complex, gateway game for non-gamers.  While I prefer Starfarers over this game, this one has the options to play with quite a few variants, most of which I have not tested out.|13|Catan

Maybe a little hard for a totally new person to understand how to do well, but learning how to play is possible for anyone.  And the randomness of the dice covers up any possible ego bruising as the new person learns to do better.  Everyone would always have won that one game if they had just rolled that 5 or 6 or 8 or 9.|13|Catan

17645|nexttothemoon|8.0|"A good solid game. I'm probably the 15th million person to say it... but it definitely is a very good ""gateway"" style game. There is the good old VP chase common to hundreds of other Euro games but there's also multiple paths to victory, trading, frustration and elation in the dice rolls, road/city building and a variable modular board which makes for a slightly different game each time. All in all a very good game... not quite great because it's still a bit too easy to be hosed by the dice no matter how hard you try to trade and negotiate your way out of the hole you are in when that damn robber is sitting on your production hex.  Above everything else this game produces fun sessions with a lot of chatter and banter. Lot's of ""Why are you picking on me?"" and ""Move the robber there to stop him from getting the sheep he needs"" type of conversations. Just for the level of interaction the game provides its worthy of its status as a good solid family game that can be played for fun without much concern who wins or loses."|13|Catan

Its so easy to teach, so easy to play, and yet it holds my interest.  That being said, I immediately bought the Seafarers expansion and can't imagine playing without it.

(A skill relying player will almost always beat a luck relying player.) The trick is not to always go for the best odds (as a 2d6 curve is rather flat), but to understand why lesser odds may be a better build (to spread numbers for instance).  The game holds up much better than so much flawed stuff with great production coming out 20 years later.|13|Catan

18003|Michael Ward|8.0|"10/11/99 Bought. I own the English third edition from Mayfair.   11/17/09 I finally played using the fourth edition. And... I think the graphics are terrible. Especially the port icons being so tiny. One third the size of the ones in the 3rd edition, and hard to tell apart from across the table. Some of the hill hexes were throwing us old hands off. They had so much green in them we weren't sure whether they were hills (producing brick) or meadows (producing wool). It seems the graphics guy decided to make every hex unique. Well, that's all fine and good if you're creating art. But a game must be functional above all else. And its very difficult to sweep the 4th ed. board with your eye and get a grasp of what is what without a lot of pausing to squint at stuff. Could Mayfair leave well enough alone? Nooooo.  02/21/17 Gamed with the 4th edition again plus its 5/6 player expansion. Same comments.   I'll let my initial rating stand, as its for my 3rd edition. But if I owned the 4th edition I'd rate Settlers a 5 for the ridiculous graphics.   03/05/16 A three-player game with the English 5th edition. The graphics were *much* better than the 4th edition. I'm not a fan of the rule changes concerning VP card play after the game is over and mixed trading & building. I feel its ""dumbs down"" the game. I also think taking ""The Settlers of"" off the box is arrogant and stupid. If I owned this version I'd rate it a 7.5."|13|Catan

18048|Elendil|8.0|I have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this game, and taught it to many people.  It remains the best game for introducing non-gamers to gaming, in part because it is very elegantly designed - does a lot with relatively few rules and components.  Also the die rolling, while an annoyance to experienced gamers, does help create some excitement for the general populace.  Even though there is very little strategy left in this for me, I still really enjoy teaching it to new players and watching their learning process.  Plus the trading is still a lot of fun.  |13|Catan

18162|Dragonspirit|8.0|This is the bread & butter game for much of my gaming circle.  It is almost perfect.  Skill typically wins, but there is always a chance to get lucky.  Even a moderately skilled player has a chance to win despite better players at the table, which makes it fun and competitive for all.  And the board changes every game, so there is no preset optimal build.  Add in the fact that you can trade, you can take hostile action with the robber and that the game punishes hoarding and it is just really well done.|13|Catan

18165|eatyourdasein|8.0|"Overall I think this is a terrific game and a fun way to kill some time by engaging in some friendly back-stabbing. There are a few tiny flaws that occasionally get in the way of the game for me, but in general I think the design allows for a nice balance between luck and strategy. And I think luck is as important a part of gameplay as strategy, so I appreciate the attention to balance in games like this.   The highlights of the game for me are the player interaction (through trading and ""unholy alliances"") and the resource management. Thinks like the ""Longest Road"" and ""Largest Army"" also provide some flexibility to strategy, and reward players for doing more than just building up settlements and cities. Building roads and buying soldiers are an important part of the game, but I think those added bonuses give the game some extra punch. All in all I think the point system is very flexible and allows for players to pursue a variety of strategies, most of which will remain viable for the entire game.   The only thing I don't like about the game is the way that resource tiles are assigned fixed numbers for dice rolling. I can't tell you how many games have become once sided slaughterfests because the dice refuse to roll anything other than five or ten (and it's always five or ten, never six or eight). In most games I've played one resource will remain scare due to the number system, which is fine and indeed a part of the game, but occasionally a ""sheep tyrant"" will emerge and destroy us all. When the game takes on a sense of inevitability it becomes a lot less entertaining and rewarding. "|13|Catan

But it still holds a special place in my heart, and I have not found a game with so much tension and cut-throat negotiations, even though it is very random.  I'm still downgrading this from a 10->8 though, simply because it's not something I'd play given the choice.|13|Catan

18287|Devon Harmon|8.0|Back in 96 this game showed me there was more out there than fantasy and war games.  When I first bought it, I couldn't get enough.  All of my friends kept asking for it to be played.  Fast forward 10 years.  I've played this game a lot, to the point that I don't really want to play it much, but I still do, at least once a year.  Really good game.  Would recommend, even if I know nothing about your tastes, as the game has very broad appeal.  My rating is higher than my true feelings at this point, but there was a time when it was clearly an 8.  Now it is more like a 6 or 7.|13|Catan

It's one of the best games to introduce to non-gamers.  The rolls can really screw you, but if you are flexible, you can usually find a way to stay competative.  (I've recently had two games of this that have made me reconsider the final statement...as well as drop this game by a full point.  They were two excruciatingly painful games.)  When it's good, it's really, really good, but you can have an occasionally frustrating run of bad dice.|13|Catan

18438|Verkisto|8.0|Having played it more times, I've dropped my rating a point.  It's too easy to get hosed for an entire game, thanks to the bad luck of the roll or others' unwillingness to trade.  There's also the possibility of winning the game strictly off of a blind draw from the deck, but to be fair, you still have to set yourself up to be in the position to pull that sort of thing off.  Additionally, I think it plays better with 4 than with 3, because there are more people involved, more numbers being rolled, and more trading going on.  In short, it has more possibilities.  It's still a fun concept, and still a great game!  20+ plays: computer 2 plays: 3 players 4 plays: 4 players  -----  Base game Austria Austria Bavaria Buch Delmarva Event Cards Fischer von Catan Frenemies Great River Große Karawane Hexels Historische Szenarien I Historische Szenarien II Indiana & Ohio Majorca New England New York North Rhine Oil Springs Penn-Jersey Rincewind und der Tourist Schokoladenmarkt Seefahrer Settlers of Hesse Städte & Ritter Thuringia YuCatan board|13|Catan

18471|qwertymartin|8.0|It's common for gamers to sour on Settlers but its ability to get new people into the hobby can't be underrated. I think the reason it's proven so enduringly popular is its familiarity to non-gamers. Like Monopoly, you roll two dice at the start of your turn and do what they say. Like Monopoly you try to build houses to enable you to gather more resources. Like Monopoly you haggle and trade with other players to try and make up sets. And compared to Monopoly, the commonly-made gamer complaint that you can be hosed by unlucky placement and dice rolls pales into insigificance - at least you can't be eliminated!   When I first played Settlers, I was blown away by how many clever things it does compared to the 'classic' games I knew: properly makes use of probability; continuously moves towards a conclusion; keeps everyone involved when it's not their turn. Sure I can see some of its weaknesses now, and it's a game that I don't really play with gamers. But I'll happily pull it out any time with my family - my non-gamer sister and her husband adore it. |13|Catan

One problem with this game is that the luck of the dice can severely set back your strategy and you find yourself hoping it isn't going to be one of those dice-dominated games.  We like to use a ""dice deck"" to solve the above problem: a deck of 36 cards labelled 2-12 in the right proportions.  "|13|Catan

18511|budsticky|8.0|"The game that started it all for me.  Found this on Xbox Live and ended up playing it all the time.  My other 60 dollar games collected dust. That game led me to this site, which led to my new boardgame obsession, which led to the Dark Side..and so on and so on.  I hesitate to give a game a 10 but according to the info on ratings: ""Outstanding.  Always want to play and expect that will never change.""  This is true for me with this game.  Unfortunately most of my gaming is 2 player, and the 2 player variants aren't nearly as enjoyable to me.  Fortunately the Xbox AI on hard is a good challenge, plus there's always live opponents..so when I need my fix I can get it.  Edited three years later from original comments above:  The game is no longer a 10 for me.  When I first got it it was really my only exposure to this type of board game.  Now that I've acquired and played many more games poor old Catan has kind of been left behind.  Still, for sheer nostalgia alone I still give this game an 8."|13|Catan

18515|hancock.tom|8.0|Truly one of the best gateway games ever.  Base game can get old after a few dozen plays and the dice can sometimes be frustrating.  Game can be obnoxious if you get screwed early by the starting placement.  Few games are as dependent on the starting placement as Settlers, which can hinder newbies who try to pick up the game as it goes.  There is a lot more tension, conflict, and interaction than you would expect.  A classic I don't think will be replaced.|13|Catan

18726|Alan Stern|8.0|"The 800-pound gorilla of board games!  I really can't say much bad about Settlers.  The dice-rolling doesn't overshadow the deeper, more strategic nature of the game.  The random layout of the tiles (at setup) and the random arrangement of the outside trading bonuses provides tons of replay potential.  The development cards are a nice mechanism for sprucing up gameplay and provide more options.  My only criticism is that Settlers isn't very heavy/deep and I tend to prefer heavier/deeper games.  It falls into that nebulous middle category – not too heavy and not too light.  But it's Settlers and it's fun and I hope I get to play more games of it in the future.  And no Settlers review would be complete without the obligatory ""I've got wood for sheep.""  There, I said it.  Happy?"|13|Catan

18730|verdigast|8.0|Klaus Teuber; In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine the current production on the island. Players collect raw materials to build up their civilizations to gain enough victory points to win the game. This game is a Spiel des Jahres (German game of the year, 1995) winner, primarily because of its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike. Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by Kosmos and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone at least 4 editions as Settlers of Catan. It has also been re-published in a travel edition by Kosmos and in yet a different edition for Japan/Asia, Settlers of Catan : Rockman Edition. Settlers of Catan is the original game in the Catan Series. Expanded by: The Seafarers of Catan, The Cities and Knights of Catan, 5-6 Player Expansion. |13|Catan

18733|Rubric|8.0|Only played once so far.  Wow, fun game!  It took close to 3 hours, which is a little on the long side, but I assume we will get quicker with experience. Also played a bumch of times on line now.  I'm debating bumping the rating up to 9 now that I've played a whole bunch of games. |13|Catan

18752|joewyka|8.0|Perfect blend of strategy and chance. While I can sympathize with those who say there is too much randomness here, I have consistently seen strong players win by positioning themselves to take advantage of probability. Mitigating the risks of chance is a big part of this game. Brilliant in its accessibility and broad appeal.  EDIT: After playing a few more times with casual gamers, I'm reducing the grade to an 8. The set up and site selection, unless you use a pre-set configuration, really does set some at a severe disadvantage. While I don't mind at all the randomness of the dice roll, it is never fun when you don't feel you have much of a chance from turn one, which can happen in this game. Also, I find that getting to that last victory point or two can be painfully slow. I usually target a number a point or two lower than recommended.|13|Catan

18771|Just Some Guy|8.0|I would rate it a 9 but in two recent games I got shut out of the competition by some spectacularly unlucky roles made me knock it down.  The fact that I could go 16 player turns without a resource when I was on the seven different numbers in one game and how the table could roll 6 on more than seventy-five percent of rolls leaving myself as the only player to not get rich in the other was just astounding.  And it was two different copies of the game so weighted dice is out.|13|Catan

It's a really fun game where you are engaged even on your opponent's turns it has high replayability and the rules aren't hard to swallow.  Great for 3 players! (In my experience having 4 players makes the game slower and much harder to play your pieces.)|13|Catan

19011|ahorn|8.0|To me, Settlers of Catan is the best game ever made. The base game is just what the name says: a basic game, originally designed way more complex. As it is, it is already a lot of fun. The varying game setup takes care for fun for quite a while. But the real strength of Settlers lies in its multiple expansion.  Moreover, Settlers provides a wonderful platform to create own scenarios, and this is where the real fun starts. Settlers is the type of game that you don't get tired of. If you do, just vary it and it is an entirely new game. Up to now, I haven't met anyone who doesn't like it.|13|Catan

This is in large part just a roll and go (Row and go for you Obama supporters) The thing that makes this game so good is everyone is involved, or can be involved in every player turn. In other words, very little down time. It does have some luck involved with the dice rowing...er...rolling but you have so much fun it does not matter.|13|Catan

After my eyes have been opened wide by BGG, I would still say this' the best family game in 20 years (over the likes of Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk) but my attention was diverted to those of Puerto Rico, Twilight Imperium III, and Android... Thus I brought down my grading for Catan to 8 from 10 as I would like to try out the others first (and the BGG grading is based on willingness to play). But my impression remained the same for Catan: it's the best family game in 20 years!|13|Catan

19278|TrentonTron|8.0|If you are only considering the game design and the ratio of luck to strategy, there are definitely better games than this. However, I have more memories of awesome times I have had playing this game than with any other game. It is very much dependent on the people playing, as I had played games that were not much fun because the players played too seriously or one player accepted pretty much any trade offer. I have won this game by only building on two hexagons before (I had four cities and believe it or not, Longest Road.) I have played a game where we combined two base sets and played to 25 VPs. It lasted three hours, but it was awesome and one of the most fun times I have had playing a board game. I love the intellectual challenge and brain burn of other games, but with the right players, Settlers is a blast, and still has enough strategy and tactics to keep me interested.|13|Catan

There is something inexplicably satisfying about the method: acquiring resources through luck, trade and theft, steadily working toward near and long-term goals, cheering when the dice fall your way.  An important Euro that is responsible for bringing these games into the mainstream of the US, and a game that is reasonably approachable for most people, nearly every geek should own this.

19533|swgod98|8.0|I wanted to rate this a 7, but have decided it is a classic that deserves a little more.  Settlers is one of the first games that introduced me to euro style games.  It's a great intro game and while there's so much more out there, it's hard not to enjoy a game of Settlers.|13|Catan

19554|rambaldo|8.0|The agreed definition of a eurogame. The gamers game closest to being mainstream (over 28k owners just here in BGG). With a lot of reasons: it has a fantastic theme, nice bits, great mechanics, and offers fun, tension, interactiion, and a wide range of different options. It has everything, a lot of strategy but also some randomness and even big screwage possibilities (here comes the robber...) The negotiation is what makes this game so exiting. We all enjoy it in our family and play iy pretty often. But IMHO it is just a little heavy to be the ideal gateway game (maybe it could be the ideal step two game)|13|Catan

19580|bullseyetm|8.0|Fun game that got me into modern board gaming.  I'll never refuse a game.  My biggest gripe is that 50% of the game is initial placement.  Judging from that alone, you can usually see the winner coming a mile away, and the game itself is just going through the motions.  Unless, of course, the die rolls are erratic (why haven't we rolled any eights?!)|13|Catan

If you give me some stone to upgrade my settlement I won't have to block you anymore.""  The 5-6 player extension is a trap."|13|Catan

It is incredibly simple to learn, yet strategic enough to allow for some deep gameplay decisions.  It very much serves as a bridge between a game like Monopoly and a game like Puerto Rico.  If you're trying to get some of your friends to dip their toe in deeper games such as the ones lauded on this website, this is definitely the game to start with.|13|Catan

Its elegance is part of its appeal, so I have no desire to play any of the subsequent versions-- at that point I'd rather play something more modern. The Atlantic got it right: ""Settlers' recipe for success can therefore be seen as this: a well-designed game, devoid of a geeky patina, incubated by early adoption into a nerd culture that has become increasingly mainstream."""|13|Catan

20412|ATURN|8.0|Got me into board games again (I liked the game Risk when I was young). This game is a lot of fun, but eventually everyone figures it out. The negotiating/trading aspect of this game makes it better than other games which I consider dry, such as Puerto Rico. In fact, this game does the trading mechanism better than any game I know. The play interaction in this game is phenomenal. I recommend the Knights and Cities expansion. |13|Catan

20487|RevEng|8.0|This was the first considerable board game I had played since I was a child playing Monopoly.  And I must say, I love it.  The game seems simple on the surface, and is relatively easy to pick up, but strategy permeates the entire game.  From placement, to building strategies, and trading for resources, every action has consequences and there are always multiple options to choose from.  Often, a single card can change your entire strategy; I often see players about to build a development card, make a good trade, and shift gears into building a city or a settlement.  With so many ways to gain points, and so many ways to build up, there are always different strategies to try.  Combined with the interaction between players and the random board designs, there is no perfect strategy, requiring players to constantly be aware and plan their next moves accordingly.  My only complaint is the fact that dice rolls determine what resources you get.  While a little randomness keeps things changing and unpredictable, resources are so important that an unlucky streak can break even the best strategy.  Combined with the exponential productivity growth, a slow start due to unlucky rolls can quickly separate the winners from the losers.  This sometimes results in people giving up mid-game, complaining that they've already lost and making unreasonable trades to break everybody else's strategy.  There's a lack of sportsmanship apparent here, but the fact that players can get into an unstoppable losing or winning position can make the rest of the game less fun.  Still, this is an excellent game that I have played dozens of times over the last couple of years and I still enjoy playing to this day.|13|Catan

20626|pie4all88|8.0|A classic for a reason.  Easy to pick up and play, Settlers is guaranteed to provide an hour or two of fun as you collect resources and expand your town.  If you're looking for an in-depth and full-featured experience, though, look elsewhere.  The frequent dice-rolling means players will start complaining about being unlucky (and rightfully so).  Be wary of the expansion packs; while they add some much-needed complexity to the game, some are worth your time more than others.  All in all, Settlers is a casual German-style board game that can be enjoyed with family and friends.|13|Catan

20675|Phantisma|8.0|My first euro-game. I don't think there can be any better introduction to gaming. Over the past few years that I've owned this game I must've played it hundreds of times and it really was the game that started it all.  My friends love playing it and it was great to see how wheeling and dealing our way to success was no longer held to chance or electronically. My immediate family also soon got into it and it's always a good way to have a family evening.  Then I brought it to holiday dinners and Catan was soon being begged for by everyone. It had topped Monopoly and Risk which were two of our classic favorites.   It was one of the games that helped me forge my gaming group here at school. It's a great introduction into the genre and while lately it hasn't received much play and has lost some of it's luster to newer shinier games Catan will always hold a special place in my heart.|13|Catan

20909|FalseComrade|8.0|This is the game that kicked off my board game renaissance, and is one I keep going back to.  Even those who aren't generally interested in board games will sit down for an hour or two to play a good game of Catan.  Even after several dozen games, I'm still not bored with the mechanics and gameplay, and can't see it happening in the near future.  Highest recommendation, for both board game enthusiasts who haven't yet played this classic, and are looking for a mildly complicated game to play with non-gamers, or for those just getting interested in gaming and are looking for a good entry-level game.|13|Catan

20919|icewolf34|8.0|I love this game. I love building up settlements and cities, trying to balance my need for different resources against the desire to corner the market on one of them. The dice roll to determine resource draws (and to enact hand size penalty) means that early-game positioning provides real advantages but keeps comebacks possible.  The only complaints that I have are that politicking takes some of the fun out (everyone hates me because I am ahead! :[ ), and bargaining can stretch the game out too long -- the game is on the long side to begin with, so hagglers can make it seem interminable.|13|Catan

20922|Dic Dic Von Dic|8.0|"We never regret sitting down to play this game. Very fun but one downside is a poor starting position can be difficult to recover from and it uses two D6 dice and dice can lose you the game. For example, nine and five should roll equally often but they are dice and of course don't neccesarily follow the ""odds"" leading to a bit of frustration. Traders & Barbarians expansion adds a deck that handles die rolls which does balance things some in this regard. "|13|Catan

[b]My thoughts[/b]: Pretty much impossible to come back as you fall behind, but that's not the fault of this game. The genius, rather, is that you continually want to try again to win next time. |13|Catan

21063|Muscles ODraves|8.0|A fun game. I bought it to avoid playing with a person I don't like, and it gives my roommates and I something to do together.  I've played this several times with 2 players and with 2+ players (with the 5-6 player expansion). I have to say that 5/6 players can get a bit crowded, but often is the most fun. Playing with two is a bit slow, but the games are always really close.  However, the luck with rolling the dice can be frustrating, and the trading aspect often leaves my friends cranky at the table.  Still, a good game over all.|13|Catan

21728|IrishRenegade|8.0|Nice easy group game with interaction and simple rules that anyone can grasp.  After numerous plays, I want something beefier and loved what C&K did for the game, although many people I know want to play just the base game.  The base game leaves me wanting more now, but that's after 60+ plays, so well worth the $.  I'me just Settler'd out and cringe when someone wants to play it.|13|Catan

It's fun to strategize around roll statistics and port locations, and the trading mechanic is always fun to me. The robber somewhat successfully keeps one player from running way ahead of everyone else, as does the trading mechanic.|13|Catan

We do not get to play very often since at least three players are required.  I would have rated it higher but it takes a long time to play (2 hrs it seems) and adding expansions make it longer.  Maybe if we continue to play it more we can speed up the game but we know when we start a game it is going to get very involved.  Edit: I've increased the rating because as we've played more, the game time has gone down.|13|Catan

21985|fformighieri|8.0|"Esse jogo é uma excelente maneira de introduzir novos jogadores brasileiros ao mundo do jogos modernos. Ele é rápido, cada partida dura em média 50 minutos. As regras são fáceis de explicar (10 minutos). A jogabilidade é fantástica pois permite uma série de possibilidades e o peso dos dados (sorte) é pequeno em comparação aos jogos tradicionais do Brasil. Na realidade a sorte no CATAN ""é para todos"" já que o valor dos dados pode prejudicar ou beneficiar vários jogadores ao mesmo tempo. Outro fator importantíssimo é que todos os jogadores sempre crescem, uns mais que outros, mas sempre crescem. O tabuleiro formado de peças hexagonais, fato novo para o brasileiro, o que gera sempre um jogo diferente do outro devido a disponibilidade e organização dos recursos.

22007|Emilarsen|8.0|One of the absolute best gateway games there is. You just can't really go wrong with Settlers, I mean Catan... anyhow.  It's not my favorite game, but it's undeniable just how much of an influence this game has been to me as a gamer and to many others. It's a game I will always suggest to others and pull out every now and then.|13|Catan

22009|Apple Paul|8.0|"Absolute classic.  Clearly works.  Creates a lot of fun.  True, most gamers eventually tire of it and move on, but it is still the golden gateway game that introduces more people into ""beyond monopoly"" gaming than any other game.  Major props."|13|Catan

22012|ericlosiewicz|8.0|"A classic that I just can't get to the table lately - definitely a sign that my collection is either too big, or I need to host more game parties.   Great trading and building game.  Only trouble I have with it is that the randomness of the base game can cause some really bad games if you have new players, so I wouldn't suggest this as a 'gateway game'.    3rd edition sold to 2nd and Charles after acquiring 5ht edition ""Catan""."|13|Catan

I suppose I thought my other, newer games somehow made Settlers obsolete; that the ideas it introduced had become commonplace.

22602|OpExp|8.0|The one that started it all. I have played many many games of Settlers and have had a great deal of fun. I can play this with almost anyone and most everyone will get a kick out of the game. If you wanna get people into board games, this is a great place to start. That said, now that I have somewhere over a 100 games played, I can see where others have fault with it. It can go on long easily, many games feel like they have been rigged against you, and after many plays it can feel like going through the motions. It's still one of my favorite games, and I think it's more strategic than it's given credit for, and even if things turn sour early, you can still have a chance to win. Still a big fan.  Edit: I am not dropping the score even though Catan drives me up a bit of a wall now. If I got 100 plays of Catan, then I think it is at least worth an 8.|13|Catan

22656|hybridfive|8.0|Not a game I seek out, but one I will always play if suggested by other people.  A math professor friend of mine taught me that the key to the game is analyzing the opening board.  You can always get beat by the luck of the dice, but knowing where the place settlements at the start of the game will mitigate random chance to significant margins.  Once you do that, the game itself becomes academic, unless at least two of the other players are similarly capable.  Basically, once you know the secret of Catan, you can only play against other people who also know the secret.  Unless you enjoy beating up on freshmen.|13|Catan

My initial excitement with the game has diminished the more we've played as luck just seems to play too big a part some games. Update: Bumped the rating up to 8 after a very enjoyable 4 player game with my wife and 2 of my kids.  Luck still plays a big part but you can make the luck work for you by choosing the numbers that are rolled most and putting your settlements on as many numbers as possible.|13|Catan

22696|DrumPhil|8.0|"Catan is a great way to introduce people to euro board games. The familiar dice roll to start your turn helps make it a great gateway for people only familiar with mass-market, roll-and-move games. It has a nice balance of simplicity and strategy. There is enough luck and interactive trading to keep things from getting stale. The variable setup plus all the expansions give it longevity and great replay value. The best thing we did was sort our pieces and expansion parts into adjustable tackle box flats and pack it all into a carrying case. It's our ""Settlers to go"" kit. I must have played between 50-100 games of Settlers before we found BGG, so my stats on this game are very under-reported."|13|Catan

22740|Elocution Safari|8.0|"The granddaddy of gateway games was my personal introduction to modern board games. It was my first euro and I was fascinated by the ""victory points"" and variable board. Before SoC I didn't know anything existed outside of Monopoly, Risk, Scrabble, etc. However, repeat plays have revealed not all is new and perfect here. Although very good with 4 players, I don't find it works with 3 or 2. The dice can be cruel, making your statistically superior strategy worthless. There can still be a runaway leader problem even with the robber and other players reluctance to trade with the leader. Also, if you happen to get boxed in early in the game there is nothing you can do to catch up.    Seafarers, Helpers, Fishermen, and 5-6 player expansions included."|13|Catan

We play Catan with our own House Rules concerning the Cities-expansion. We do not use the Knights portion of the expansion, only the cities, because we wanted to create a commerce and development centered gaming experience.

22852|Happymrdave|8.0|"It's quite a shame that it has become ""cool to hate"" on Catan. Still a highly entertaining game that can be quite cutthroat among experienced players. I personally find it best with 4 and I'm not a fan of the 5-6 player expansions much, and nor is it as good with 3, but still worth periodically revisiting."|13|Catan

This is a simple game, but my family and I like it. My kids 8+ can all understand the rules and play it. I can bring this out and play with non-board gamers and get them to enjoy it, too. We have bought many, many board games since then, and still enjoy Catan. I am glad we have this game in our board game collection.       I do not like the tiles, they are not hard to set up, but impossible to keep in place. We place a huge piece of glass on top of them to keep 'em there. "|13|Catan

The game also has enough expansions to keep veteran players busy for quite a while. If the luck of dice rolls isn't your thing there are decks of cards (I think in the Traders and Barbarians expansion) to take their place for a more even distribution of resources.|13|Catan

23009|Perrytom|8.0|I too was brought into this kind of gaming by Settlers of Catan... Sort of. I was introduced to this game and then bought it, and played it for something like 3 years nonstop. I introduced it to many people and spared the word around, but was never really interested in any of the expansions or any other games.   In time I learned how big and incredible the world of gaming is, and I left Catan behind. I rarely ever want to play that anymore. Perhaps because I played it so much, I now tend to avoid it since I really have no more interest in 'figuring this game'.   Nonetheless, I played it so much as if it was the only game in the world. |13|Catan

23258|vdbmalmsteen|8.0|One of the new classic games. Luck plays a role. Might Wanda try the rule below:  The random dice drove me nuts. I'd be sitting on a 6, 8, 5 and 9, and everyone would be rolling 4's and 10's. I later learned of a rule used in Settlers of America: If your number isn't rolled, you gain 1 gold coin. On your turn, you can exchange 2 gold for any 1 resource at. You can do this twice per turn (you can spend a max of 4 gold per turn). If a number is rolled but is blocked by a robber, that player does not receive gold. |13|Catan

23558|Angrist|8.0|For the level of simplicity of its mechanics, this game is pretty much perfect, apart from the theme being excessively dry and bland. However, it could be more ambitious and have more direct interaction in it somehow. I also feel the rounds pass too slowly because of the die roll and resource collecting at the start of each turn: this could perhaps be sped up somehow such as by each player taking their resource for the round simultaneously, for example, or something along those lines.|13|Catan

23625|theguz|8.0|"I was not impressed with this game the first time I played it.  I think this is because the person who taught it to me didn't do a very good job.

23627|EMAWesome|8.0|Here it is, the game that got me into real board games. For that alone it deserves a high rating. The most unique board that is random every time with many classic game elements including trade, building, dice rolling, and victory points. The artwork and pieces are all high quality, though I'm still a little torn at whether I like the newer version or not.  As for pure gameplay, the dice do matter a fair amount but at least its based on probabilities.  Still, those games where it seems like 4s and 10s are rolled more than an 8 or 6 can be annoying.  I like playing this every so often, it really doesnt get old.|13|Catan

23709|Just_Lucky|8.0|A hour long game that can come down the to turning of a single card to finish it. The winning conditions are awkward leading to 'oh, I have won - that was a surprise.' type reaction. Also, players can get left behind in the whole development process.  Edit: Oh but it does have it moments and it survives repeated plays without getting old quickly.|13|Catan

I keep trying different strategies and still haven't found one that works for me, but also beats the other players.  I've tried keeping my starting towns close, separating my towns, keep my towns towards the inside of the island, both on the outside near ports, and a combination of all of those.  Don't know... I do enjoy it though. |13|Catan

This makes assembly of the board challenging and frustrating - moreso the more often it is played. Aside from that, Catan uses a relatively simple game mechanic that is easy to pick up on and fun to play. Best played with 4 players in order to maximize the trading/barter features and competition.|13|Catan

I had no idea there was any other way of making games other than roll to move. Subsequent German games I've tried don't even use Dice! Germans are so clever. :) Anyone that tries to deny the importance of Settlers to this hobby is either lying to themself or has just had unfortunate experiences playing this with bad groups.

Simple to learn, but yet some strategic death.  The game is marred somewhat by ""accumulated advantage"", once you fall behind it's hopeless and that's usually obvious to everyone.  If players are paying attention they will cease trading with the leader, which helps to some degree.  Also marred somewhat by too much randomness in the consequences of dice throws and who gets the the resources."|13|Catan

24165|Olafslomp|8.0|This is my gateway game. Not that it got me into gaming, but it introduced me to euro games, which have been a huge part of my hobby ever since. I burnt out on this for a while, having played this A LOT between 1995 and 2005, but have played some games in the last couple of years and am enjoying it again (adding in some expansions helped to give it a fresh feel). Also have started introducing it to my kids now. I think this had stood the test of time very well. It has held a solid place in my collection for 20 years now. I would say it’s great to start new gamers with this game, but I havn’t met anybody that hasn’t played Settlers in a long time (well, other than my kids, but they learned gaming before I taught them Settlers).|13|Catan

That'll be the same amount as the base game. Want to play 5 or 6 players? that'll be $20 per for the base game and an additional $20 for each expansion. If that's what the market will bear, then I'm not the target market.|13|Catan

24301|RedcapSue|8.0|This is the game that I learned about Euro Board Games on.  I found the cooperative nature of the game great but I could still be somewhat competitive if I so chose.  Even with a full compliment of players I found game play to go fairly quickly.  Great for a group of strangers to get to know each other and just as great for a group of friends.   |13|Catan

24315|aCardboardBox|8.0|Although it doesn't look like it, Settlers is the modern day Monopoly in success and play.  The game has you roll two dice in order to grab resources and there's also a lot of negotiation in it too.  That being said, there can be a chance that a player gets hosed because of unfortunate set up and die rolls, which makes this game far from perfect.|13|Catan

24605|runningidiot|8.0|I rarely win Catan, but I still have loads of fun. It is a strategist's game; someone who can loves looking at the board and predicting everyone's future moves and how to block them. It also has a decent amount of random luck, which, in my opinion, every game needs otherwise it would be like Chess. If I wanted to play chess, I would play chess. Settlers of Catan is a timeless game. One that I can bring out and have fun with without any of the expansions. Personally I don't think it needs expansions, the core gameplay elements would be ruined I think if you threw in some crazy ideas. Then again, I can't really talk since I haven't played a whole lot of them. Overall, Catan is a great game with great player interactions and great mechanics. Love it.|13|Catan

24760|OreThief|8.0|Vanilla Settlers is a good gateway game. I would recommend it with 3-4 people at most. Some people argue that luck plays too much a role, but I really think that it depends on the group of people you play with. A quiet non-negotiating group will play very differently than one where everyone is offering quick and clear trades. I've played the game for years, and I think that in many ways, although luck plays a role, the skill lies in assembling wins in spite of bad rolls or bad initial placement.  I think the game suffers more from the ability for a player to play kingmaker.  For gamers who desire something more complex, I would recommend playing with the Cities and Knights expansion, which adds more ways to win, while retaining the core mechanics.|13|Catan

24888|fogus|8.0|2016 ====  Catan is my family's favorite board game. As a gift to my oldest son a couple of years ago, Catan stands as possibly the best bang for our buck game purchase... well... ever. Whenever we have 2 hours to spare (rare these days) we break out this staple and rock and roll. Recently my family has taken to colluding against me (3 on 1) from the start. This doesn't bother me one bit as it adds a real edge to the game for me and presents quite a challenge to my wining prospects. I tend to not be a fan of explicit negotiation in games, but when it works it's exquisite.  [2014.03.01] I like its general appeal and the ability to get in a quality game with people who wouldn't otherwise play games.|13|Catan

25192|dhelsby|8.0|The game that got me interested in board games.  I love the variability of the board and having to make the best of situations that aren't always within your control.  An element of randomness with the dice, but still rewards strategic thinking.  Feels great to place a settlement in the most awkward place for your opponents and watch the despair on their face when you do it!  |13|Catan

It's dirt-simple, and it's balanced like a dream. I rarely have games finish that aren't incredibly tight. Don't let the group get addicted to it; pull out Alien Frontiers or Small World to get them into something slightly more advanced. But think about the Milton Bradley games you may have grown up on... all the roll and moves and totally one-sided games of Monopoly. Then consider that you can buy Settlers at most major department stores. We live in a golden age, people.|13|Catan

25369|adamken47|8.0|As with many other gamers, Catan introduced me to the world of designer board games. It was a huge hit with my friends, my roommates, my family, and even me. I say this because I rarely desire to play it.  I've become Cataned out, most likely because I've moved on to greener pastures (with other sheep). My tastes in games have become more clear and I've developed a palate that is more defined, making Catan slip in my regards. Add to that the fact that my brother always wants to play Catan and I've become a little burned out on it.  However, it's a classic, both in the history books and in my mind. I've played enough games to realize that Catan is still one of my favorites, despite my hesitance to play it sometimes. I'm more willing to try new things and introduce a friend or family member to a game that is perhaps a little more thrilling or deep or thematic. All that said, Catan is a splendid game.|13|Catan

25511|xbnicholsx|8.0|Probably not much more can be said about this game, but it's historically probably one of the most played games in my collection with a variety of groups. Nowadays I play games mostly with family, and this is one of our standards. I probably would not choose it as often as we play it, but it has stood the test of time and is still an entertaining enough game that I don't mind playing it when other people make the request.   The variable game board and luck of the dice rolls make each game different enough to avoid to much same-ness from game to game. Good for just about everyone, but probably less enjoyed by those who dislike lucky swings in games as it relies heavily on the aforementioned dice rolls. There is some room for strategy in what spaces you choose at the start and where you decide to build, but really the success of those choices is relegated to the dice. That doesn't bother me as I like a little luck shakedown in my games (probably because pure strategy isn't my strong point!)|13|Catan

25831|Ox  Alias|8.0|Great fun, very well balanced.   Tactics are important, and the role of luck is minimised as in this game you make your own luck by being aware of probabilities.   The trading element is good fun, as you bargain with opponents and cut deals.  There are also various ways to go about winning, so you can try different approaches each time - especially as the board is made up differently each game forcing different strategies.|13|Catan

Sometimes the dice just hate me and it can make the game a drag. That is because I don`t play Settlers so often anymore. Troyes, Kingsburg and Stone age deal with dice in a better way so they have replaced Settlers pretty much completely. |13|Catan

26115|adularia25|8.0|Played Settlers again, as part of a team with my husband against other people at the Ballard Library Board Game Night.  And we utterly demolished our competition.  So, some of the players were close, but we made the best trades and had the best strategy.  We won with the longest road (no surprise for me) and it was the first time my husband and won, so that was awesome.  All in all it was a good night!  Played this at the Library again, and without mercy, I stomped my opponents, dividing them with my longest wall, creating a wood monopoly, and making some very smart trades.  My husband was almost tied with me - it was an extremely competitive and very close game.  It was great!|13|Catan
26116|taloskhaos|8.0|A classic, perhaps one of the few euro-esk games I will ever really enjoy.  Because I am a Star Trek fan and the Star Trek version adds an interesting character mechanic and better theme, I would rather play that but this is still a solid game with light theme and it will forever remain one of the greatest games made because it ushered in a new board game era for gaming, particularly in the US.|13|Catan

26131|NagyDagy|8.0|Egyik játszópajtimnak van meg egy pár kiegészítővel együtt. Már rágtam a fülét egy ideje, hogy hozza már el egyszer! Aztán legutóbb nála játszottunk, úgyhogy nem volt kibúvó. Remek játék, baromira élveztem!! Rendkívül egyszerű szabályok (csak az alappal játszottunk), nincs min sokat gondolkodni, és bevon a játék minden másik játékos körébe is. Az üzletelgetést minden játékban élvezem, itt is jókat mulattunk rajta; ami talán kicsit zavaró lehet, az a kocka, bár ezt most nem éreztem (most szerencsém volt, és jól jött ki nekem). Igazából némi izgalmat hoz, hogy várjak e még, vagy cseréljek... Egy szó mint száz, nagyon klassz! Legközelebb bedobunk egy pár kiegészítőt is!|13|Catan

26462|mrcmurphy|8.0|In boardgaming culture, the term 'Gateway Game' applies to any game that reintroduces players to the hobby. These games generally have more strategic depth and interesting decision making than 'classic' board games.  Catan was my gateway game. I played the hell out of Catan when I first got it. I kept it in my car for quick access, I played it so often. It is an excellent game, with many exciting opportunities for player interactions.  Now that I have more experience with the hobby, there are a few aspects of Catan that bug me. I'm not a big fan of the dice-rolling aspect, but the game does a good job of keeping the playing field level. In a lot of games, one player can end up far ahead of the other players, though this situation doesn't come up too often. These criticisms aren't very big, but they are worth mentioning nonetheless.  Overall, Catan is an excellent game, and I would happily play it at any time.  Sidenote: Never make a 3 for 1 trade.|13|Catan

26667|Nopysmurf|8.0|This game pulled me back to the board gaming world, after a pause of almost 20 years. Playing it for the first time in December 2013 and was fascinated by its simplicity yet elegant gameplay. It was definitely a 10 for me as a new gamer who just (re)entered this paper gaming world.  After so many plays during the past years, I started playing other games and was exposed to much more complex and eye-openning gameplay mechanisms. So, I (as an experienced casual gamer) updated The Settlers of Catan as an 8.   April 2015, Stuttgart|13|Catan

26812|nixonstapemachine|8.0|As is the case for many, Catan was my first modern board game, and I loved it. I still do, even if playing it often leaves me a bit on the frustrated side. For the most part a very well designed game, the only complaint I have about Settlers is the pronounced role of luck, given that your ability to carry out any strategy is largely contingent on rolls of the dice. You can position yourself in theoretically the perfect position, but if you don't get the dice rolls, you don't get the goods. Within the scope of my experience, it is unusual for a game to seem to require so much strategy while having that strategy contingent on so very much good fortune.|13|Catan

26949|lifehouserocks95|8.0|A great starter game for anyone getting into board gaming. Excellent, social and very fun! Establishing a good starting position and facilitating good trade deals with the other players is essential. Dice introduces random luck factor and there are multiple ways to vie for victory points. Love playing this as an alternative to my other heavier games. :) Review ->https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuJUBPkj3xw|13|Catan

27159|Rodge|8.0|"Pre-Catan, I used to like Board Games, but wouldn't have really been that into them. Post-Catan, I realised that what I knew of board games was very out-dated.   I'd say that my experience of playing Catan is similar to so many people. Our friends introduce us to Catan and it serves to bridge the gap in our appreciation for board games. We realise that Monopoly, Cluedo and Game of Life are not really ""good"" games at all. We realise that player elimination is a bad thing. We learn that the mechanics of the new wave of board games are so much more of an experience than what we had as kids. Most of all, we learn that board games are now really fun!  The mechanics of the game are very simple, but can bring out great strategy. Luck can be a factor, as in any game with dice, but dice go both ways in games. Of course, good strategy and luck with dice can be overcame by players scheming and grouping up against one player - so it's always unlikely that one player will always win!  While I don't get to play Catan as often anymore, I'm still usually happy to join a game when it's suggested. And for a new gamer, it is still part of my armory to try and get them hooked.   Catan will now and forever occupy a favorable place in my memories of gaming!"|13|Catan

27188|coastermonger|8.0|"Like so many others, for me Catan was the ""gateway game"" that brought me into the wider world of table tops past risk and monopoly.    It rates a solid 7 for   1) having an accessible shallow learning curve that's easy to pick up in less than 10 minutes 2) for being balanced enough to have multiple different paths to victory 3)for often forcing cooperating and trading between the players.  4) and of course, for having a ton of map and number variation so you're never playing the same game twice.  As a downside, the game falls on the side of a little too random in my book.  There will be some play sessions where you swear your numbers will never come up.  The person who wins probably had a good strategy, but also wins with a fair amount of luck.  Yes this makes the game more accessible for some novice players, but it also makes it the kind of game that I'm more reluctant to walk into.    I've found that the ""Oh I just got screwed by bad rolls"" mindset is mitigated when you:  A) make the map bigger with expansion sets B) increase the number of victory points required to win  However, this can greatly extend the length of the game depending on how efficient your opponents end their turn"|13|Catan

27216|dmadison|8.0|This game had so much hype that I was a bit disappointed the first couple of times that I played.  I enjoy it a bit more now but there are some minor problems. The starting position is crucial and it is hard to come back if you get behind. With 4 players things often get way too cramped.  The Cities and Knights expansion turns this into a much more interesting game.|13|Catan

27330|David_Tennant_10|8.0|"A well designed game. The idea were you roll your dice then collect resources is different than most games I've played. Not to mentioned that the goal is just ten points... Which is just enough time for you to get your fair share of fun from the game, but at the same time not to over kill the amount of glory the game deserves.  This game is also quite simple, meaning this game could be refered to as a gateway game. A gateway game is a game that leads people who pretty much only knows how to play checkers to play more games. Like ""Power Grid"", """"Ticket to Ride"", ""The Resistance"", and many more. However I would not give this a ten because... Well, the game really doesn't give you that much options to do things, in other words you can only do what the game itself gives you.  So if you are a person who likes to kinda sit back and watch the show, or game so to speak (I know I do sometimes) then this is probably the game for you. I know I like to actually legit participate in a game when I play it and this game doesn't really allow it. But I find my own ways to strategise in this which is one of the reasons I gave it such a high rating. This game also deserves a high rating because it is a very, VERY good family game. So if you want to spend more time with your family, this would be a good game for you."|13|Catan

27776|wallclimber13|8.0|Routine gamers like to hate on this game but I still like it. Sure I like a heavier game at times and I'm not a hardcore gamer but this game still has it's place. Just enough luck to allow less experienced players to win from time to time but still experience driven. You can't say it's all luck if the same 2 people win 90% of the time :-p. I'll always keep this in my collection and pull it out from time to time. I don't care for the expansions though (only played seafarers and cities/knights) except for the 5-6 player expansion. I feel the expansions complicate the base game enough to make it less fun for newer players but don't add enough to make it much more fun for experienced players. |13|Catan

I think the mechanics are simple once you have played the game and seen them in action, as I've taught a number of people to play and they all look lost until about halfway through playing. If you have not tried this game yet, I encourage you to jump in ASAP|13|Catan

This has to be a 9.5 - I only haven't enjoyed it much when halfway through my first play I realised that dominating sheep and having no source of brick was a fatal error, and another time when a friend trolled us by taking twice the amount of time to complete moves than he should have, when he already knew what he was going to do. 2-player variants aren't as enjoyable either, but none of the boxes suggest playing with 2 players, despite some expansions allowing you to play with 2 players.  Absolutely essential game for any board game fan!"|13|Catan

28277|Papa Ninja|8.0|[b]Catan[/b]  [COLOR=#FF0000]UPDATE:[/COLOR]  [i]Unfortunately I haven't had the opportunity to play this again, so I don't have anything new to add. I've decided against getting a copy, I already have too many games to play with my family that are best with four so I'll just have to wait to play again.[/i]   [COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]  [i]So it took four years in the hobby before I finally got a chance to play Catan and although it now seems to be easily dismissed, I found it to be great fun. I think it would still be a great gateway into the hobby since it feels familiar to games most people have played while also introducing player interaction via trading. Personally TTR would still be my gateway game of choice, but I'll probably pick up a copy of Catan because I think it'll be a hit in my house and with our extended family.[/i]|13|Catan

28713|Bazmondo123|8.0|The Grail of games. This game got me into modern day gaming. It's my 'go to' when spreading the word of how great gaming is.  Got everything, building, worker placement,take that, pit style trading, great components, strong theme, plays in an hourish, easy rules, etc  But you knew that anyway!!  Only down side to me is that it has never had a climactic ending |13|Catan

28785|chrisbrewer916|8.0|"This is simply a classic.  No other game changed board gaming more than Catan.  Without this game most of us would never have gotten into modern board gaming.  This is also the most deceptively cut throat euro out there.  For a game with ""no conflict"", I have seen more arguments and hurt feelings during this game than any other I've played.  And it's awesome.  I may not be able to attack you directly, but when I cut you off with my roads and then refuse to trade you that wheat you need after I played the ""Monopoly"" card and took all of yours...classic.  This game gets a lot of hate, but there is a reason so many people have played it.  The most common criticism is that initial placement is the most important aspect and then it's all luck and dice rolls.  I disagree.  This is a negotiation game.  All other game mechanics revolve around the trade mechanic.  Victory or defeat is all based on how well you can trade and convince other players to give you the resources you need to win.  If you play thinking that you can ignore this and win through mechanics alone, you are playing wrong."|13|Catan

29005|wuestling|8.0|I grew up with this game. Settlers replaced Skat(!) in our local pub as the game you could play every evening – there were always players coming to the pub wanting to play Settlers and the pub soon purchased a game so nobody had to bring his own. I was still a little kid accompanying my parents, later it was the favourite boardgame to play with friends for many years.  Two aspects of the game that stand out for me: random drawing of the whole island and the trading aspect. The trading is the core of the game – you roll the dice to earn resources that you can trade. And you can trade everything: three corn make one beer, three sheep to drive me home tonight. Again, this is meant to be a social/pub game as the players do not play just for themselves against each other. As for the random aspect, this game is so customizable. You could use the 6 player expansion or just a second base game to build a bigger map and/or play up to 15 or even 20 points. You can also make one or two resources very scarce or even non-existent. Endless variations.  One bad thing about the game is that it can be boring or frustrating if there are players of different levels as the random aspect is not as big as in, say, Monopoly. Settlers is quite easy to learn (as for the rules of the game) but better players play much faster and know what things to do in certain situations. Peacefully developing your stuff turns into hecticly buying basically everything you can get. So this may be one aspect Settlers share with Skat – you might play it with players at the same level as you are slowly getting better at it. In my opinion, this game is mainly made for three players. So again – sort of a Skat replacing board game... Just be sure to get the old edition with wooden parts and cleaner artwork or even the anniversary wooden box. The newer edition with plastic parts is just ugly.|13|Catan

29012|MrMelton|8.0|"This game is very fun, but I cannot imagine someone liking this and hating monopoly.  The trading, the dice, the building ""houses and hotels"", the cards giving you extra resources and similar goodies......it's all very familiar, but it is more fun with the right crowd, if you're willing to teach newcomers.  But everyone knows monopoly and it's basically the same game."|13|Catan

29044|tsothoga|8.0|Excellent intro to Euro-style board games, with an easily graspable theme. For new players, Catan is a great way to introduce the concept of a game with a few different paths to victory, but the end-game becomes a little stale, as players get locked into chasing their only path to victory. |13|Catan

Analyzing the varying board and proposing trades are the only parts of the game the player has much control over; luck plays a major role. While I have played this game countless times, the luck factor has ultimately gotten tiresome for me, this game is still a classic however.|13|Catan

I would suggest people take care in placement of initial settlements as they are vital to doing well in the game. Poor placement will result in little enjoyment of the game (My uncle found this out firsthand).|13|Catan

However, high envolvement of dice in the resource production which can be desliked by experienced gamers. Not a game i prefer to bring in the table anymore, but i feel like i have to keep it in my collection,  it will alway be a classic.  Was a  solid 9.5-10, 20 years ago, nowadays it s more like a 7 to me. I m rating an 8, due to the impact it had in gaming history!|13|Catan

29495|The Nue|8.0|"To be clear, my 8 stars is trying to be objective... if I'm being honest, I'd love to never play this game and you'd need to brow-beat me to get me to at this point... But that because I've played it SO many times because it is just SO good. It's a genre-breaker and a classic for a reason, it's a brilliantly designed game fit for causals or hardcore tacticians, total nerds or family game night with grandparents and nieces; it's simple, quick, and bland enough to not intimidate anyone, while complex enough to please real gamers. It's only redundancy and the fact recent games have filled the niche better that have this collecting dust on the shelf at this point... it definitely covered it's price tag in the day. My one big piece of advice? Avoid the exapnsions. Like the plague. It's like how various ""Battle chess"" rules alterations to the namesake can't every live up to the original... the game is already in a good place tactically... Adding elements is supurfluous, and it makes it so you aren't getting better at Catan, you're getting better at screwy fake Catan. Being a grand-master chess player is impressive, nobody cares how you'd rank nationally in like Fantasy Chess or whatever... just get good at the game itself (or better yet, branch out to its successors... I suggest Machi Koro if you want something else outsider approachable, or Valeria Card Kingdoms if you want something deeper and nerdier."|13|Catan

29699|Mr Business|8.0|A great game which involves a lot of interaction amongst the players. Trading makes up a big part in it which makes it so interesting as you sometimes have to sacrifice resources in order to trade them for another resource in smaller amounts which will eventually lead to a successful accomplishment of some sort. The only bummer is the luck factor which does consume a big part of the game. Hopefully an expansion can fix this. It is a really fun family game and I'd recommend it to anyone.|13|Catan

29808|Tjam|8.0|"This is the original board game I played that drew me away from games like ""Skip-bo"", and ""Monopoly"".  I always loved board games, but these games drive my obsession.  The level of strategy offered is so much greater than games I grew up with, and this was the catalyst.  However, it's mechanics are a little weak compared to some of the others.  Mainly, you can still lose to the dice, rather than lose to the opponent.  And while I don't dare rate this game any lower than an 8, it really has fallen out to just a good game that I like to play."|13|Catan

29911|sestovic|8.0|Catan is a very good family game, but after several games it lacks of depth for me. I also bought expansion : Traders and barbarians and we almost never play without it now. But still if you get a bad position at a start , you sometimes already know who's gonna win at the end. But if you are new to board games or looking for a family game , i recommend Catan.|13|Catan

29937|swornabsent|8.0|Catan is the gateway game that it's touted to be because it cohesively has a little of everything: dice rolling as the bridge from the classic family games of old, Euro-style resources, route building, hand management, a modular board consisting of hex tiles, and even a social aspect via trading. And light enough to teach in just a few minutes and play in about an hour.|13|Catan

30191|tgates01|8.0|Fun game, simple to learn, and possibly the perfect game for players of all ages and skill levels. Very easy to sink hours into the game, and it is usually fun throughout. The only negative things that I have to say about the game is that it seems to rely a bit more on luck than skill at times, and that the game can be arguably too simple.|13|Catan

30327|olstockings|8.0|Catan (or, the Settlers of Catan) was the game that really got me into the hobby, like many other people. While there are other mechanics I like more, and other games that are higher on my play list, the mix of strategy and necessary player interaction is a good mix. I like that the game is pretty easy for a non-gamer to get into, and some of the expansions are really good (Cities and Knights is my favorite). Catan is still a solid game, and I'm always happy to play it.|13|Catan

30474|FonnParr|8.0|Great family game. Plenty of room for a variety of strategies. My copy has a board which is made from heavy card, which does not lay flat, especially the six surrounding pieces. Some of the colours are not easy to distinguish, especially the red/orange pieces and the desert tile looks very similar to the grain tiles, although this is not an issue normally as this tile does not have a number on it.|13|Catan

It might me my ignorance, but in has a revolutionary feel to it because it opened up a whole range of possibilities in board gaming. Definately a must have. Besides that I've played games 10+ years ago that I can still remember, lots of fun and good memories, and still engaging after all these years.|13|Catan

There is a great deal of luck in this game, a little more than I would like; the dice rolls, the selection of the progress cards, etc. But still very enjoyable.|13|Catan

30734|Cstranger|8.0|Not much can be said about this game that hasn't already been said. It is a great game starting game to get people into boardgames. It's a staple to have in a collection since it was one of the firsts to change how boardgames were. It is a game that I will always love to play even though that stupid robber always seems to get rolled. I love the way the game plays and the interactions between the players. It is a definite must buy for someone starting their collection out if you are like me and got started with monopoly.|13|Catan

30767|czerwona_kotka|8.0|Wiem, że jest pojazd po tej grze, prawie jak po Talismanie i Monopoly, ale uważam że to naprawdę świetna gra familijna. Jest to moja pierwsza planszówka, do której mam spory sentyment i zawsze chętnie do niej wracam (ale w tym momencie już tylko z jakimś, choćby mini-dodatkiem). Za każdym razem mamy inne ułożenie planszy, a losowość wyrzuconych oczek na kościach (czasem zupełnie wbrew wszelkim zasadom prawdopodobieństwa) sprawia, że gra wygląda za każdym razem inaczej. Największe emocje są oczywiście przy grze w 4 osoby - dużo możliwości blokowania i rozbudowany handel. Ta gra opiera się na zawieraniu chwilowych sojuszy, za chwilę ich zrywaniu, dużo tu jest negatywnej interakcji, ale w takim pozytywnym tego słowa znaczeniu.|13|Catan

While it's true that poor starting locations can lose you the game from the very beginning, Catan's negotiation system allows for an interesting experience granted that the rest of the group is willing the play along.|13|Catan

Catan doesn't take long to play so if your looking for a game that doesn't take much time out of your day but still has enough excitement this is your game.

30882|Stridix|8.0|Pros:   + Good and simple game to play + Good for board game beginners + Decent mechanics ( Ex. Robbers to keep hoarders/monopoly of a single resource in check) + Good for competitive people + Quality components and have some waterproof ability (spilled beer on it and cardboard only got a little wet on sides) + Decent Strategy as there are many ways to win + Fun to play with many people + Playing time is moderate, not too long and not too short.  Cons: - Luck of the dice roll - Only max four players.  need to get expansions for 5-6 players - Might get hurt in competitive game (slap on wrist when opponents know you are monopolizing a resource) :/ - Maybe too much downtime:  Ex. Wish there is a timer on your actions when a player has 32 card resources on their hand and trying to figure out how to use them best - Could cost a bit w/ 5-6 (maybe around 40-50 bucks).  Better strategy games out there for that kind of cost. - Wouldn't be great to play multiple times in the same day. - Many expansions.  Could cost a lot more for certain people.|13|Catan

Even though the game's theme isn't everyone's cup of tea, it's still a great game with enough luck and strategy that it doesn't become boring or dull. The randomization of tiles is a pretty cool system. The only problem is when you pick up a place with less frequent numbers for your first settlements, since these will be the foundations of your entire game. It's crucial to understand dice statistics before playing, otherwise it can be very frustrating for some players. A very good and fun game, overall.|13|Catan

We have settled on Cities and Knights expansion, usually with seafarers islands, ships, etc.  I must say i'm tired of teaching beginners the basics - these games can drag on.  Why doesn't everyone know Catan?  Get out there and play, newbies!|13|Catan

31471|Caverius|8.0|It's nice, I can even play it with my 7 year old cousins and we all have a very good time. Overall it is the definition of a modern classic, it gets an 8 just because I find some other games provide me a much more active and challenging experience, but I absolutely respect the design for what it is and how adaptable it can be for any age range.|13|Catan

31482|beatsmd|8.0|Comments based on: 2 recent plays and dozens of plays pre-BGG logging; owned.  Things I like: • Trading mechanic keeps everyone engaged • Mix of chance (dice rolling) and strategy (decisions about how to allocate resources and what and where to build) • Long enough for players to implement a strategic plan but short enough that you have energy and time to play again • Lots of expansions are available, including a 5-6 player expansion • Easy to learn and explain (a great gateway game)  Things I dislike: • The modular board is relatively small, so a player's options can sometimes become very restricted early in the game • The core game doesn't support 5-6 players • Overplayed (who hasn't played Catan?)|13|Catan

31675|Desperandum|8.0|Classic game. Been playing it for years, and it was the game the really introduced me to board gaming and strategy games. Would highly recommend it, especially with newer gamers. Easy to teach, but hard to get really good at. Highly recommended.|13|Catan

31678|dvoltmer|8.0|"This game was my introduction to modern board gaming. I introduced this game to many non-gamers. I enjoy introducing people to basic probability when placing settlements. Trading is also very fun. After a while I only played Cities and Knights.  Cities certainly has more ""take that"" but also more strategy. The weakness often cited in this game is that the early rolls can largely determine the winner."|13|Catan

Base game is a bit boring after a while especially after playing with several of the expansions but is great for introducing newcomers only familiar with games such as Monopoly and the like.|13|Catan

31702|Eugeniosaracino|8.0|"Para mí, Catan es a los juegos de mesa, lo que los Beatles a la música popular. Claramente marcó un antes y un después desde su edicion. Me encanta y en mí entorno de amigos funciona perfecto. Siempre nos llaman para jugarlo. La edición ""nueva"" ilustrada por Michael Menzel ha logrado que los hexagonos tengan un nivel de detalle asombroso, haciéndolo visualmente hermoso.  Sinceramente no entiendo a aquellos enemigos fervientes que tiene el juego. Qué está superada la mecánica con propuestas más novedosas? Ok. Qué tiene mucho azar? Ok. Cuál es el inconveniente? Muchos de los que estamos en este mundillo, no estaríamos acá de no ser por Catán. No seamos ingratos con este clásico enorme."|13|Catan

31751|ROSIEonFIRE|8.0|This is a great game for anyone who is just getting into board games.  While I enjoyed the original, I got bored of it after I played it a few times because once you establish a winning trajectory it is really hard for anyone to overtake you.  That being said, if you have never played Catan before I would recommend actually picking up Star Trek: Catan.  The Star Trek version has an extra game mechanic which mixes things up a bit and ups the replayability.  Still a classic though.|13|Catan

31835|M Cotton|8.0|The first boardgame I ever bought!! It's not the best game, but it surely is a good one. Sure, something like Stone Age can replace it and be better, but Settlers is still an almost perfect gateway game. Nearly everyone should have a copy, and you can feel confident bringing it to the family holiday to teach and enjoy with both gamers non-gamers alike. Although nowadays I'd say Pandemic or Carcassonne take its place as the standard first-choices to share with non-gamers, you still can't go wrong with a family game of Catan. This will always be a classic. Most gamers might be tired of it, but that doesn't make it any less of a giant.|13|Catan

That said, it definitely has some frustrating elements.  Luck plays too big of a role, it's too easy for players to gang up against the leader and it snowballs pretty hard.

31982|Ickyhouse|8.0|This was the gateway game for my family to trend towards more Euro/strategy games. very fun to play, not difficult to learn, multiple strategies to win and good replay value. Cons: a LOT of bickering if your family is like that. Similar to monopoly in that the competition is direct. Almost like a battle game. For some that is good. My family loves to argue with each other so it's not so bad. It can also get stale after enough plays, but by that time you have gotten your money's worth.|13|Catan

32041|tbar4848|8.0|The classic. Hard not to look at with rose coloured glasses, but it still hits the table. Make sure to highlight to new players to the importance of starting positions and development cards.  For all its fun, it is a game where you can still get virtually knocked out. In our group that person often becomes king maker, shifting the balance of power significantly. It's not a real Catan game if at least one person isn't upset. = )|13|Catan

32413|elegyfordoom|8.0|Not much can be said about the game that hasn't been said already a thousand times - it's a classic! Very easy to get into and enjoy, and not hard to come up with strategies as well. I immensely enjoyed playing it in the first few months, when I hooked a lot of my friends and we played long hours, even while on holiday. The one single thing that ruins the game for me and the reason I stopped preferring it is the weight of the luck factor which is inevitable for a dice game, but in Catan you can really feel the dice's effect.|13|Catan

32556|canadamarcus|8.0|I first got into board games from some friends who introduced me to Settlers of Catan Cities and Knights, so the base game is fun, but I'd rather add the C&K expansion, hence the 8/10. Def a great game, still fun to play without the expansions, I just prefer the added depth of Cities and Knights|13|Catan

32566|rainyl|8.0|经典的「双卡一城」推新游戏之一。 虽然已经发售几十年了，目前看起来仍然是最佳推新桌游之一。 在卡坦岛中，所有的产出直观地摆在岛上，骰子对于产出的影响让每一次掷骰时都充满了希望与失望，运气与运营对于最终胜利的影响比重很微妙，让新人可以产生很大的参与感。 缺点么，策略深度比较浅，老手之间的对局胜负全在最后几轮的骰运，以及藏了几张胜利点数卡。|13|Catan

If only some of those roads looked more like roads and those other bits were something other than wood.  Oh...but then it wouldn't be a Euro.  Hmm, would it be considered a 'Rebellion' since it is an Ameritrash departure from a stoic Euro?|13|Catan

32868|ssully858|8.0|It is the Harry Potter of the board game community.  Everyone should give credit to this game for revitalizing the board game community.   The game mechanics are interesting and simple, but my only complaint is that the placing of your beginning pieces can make or break your game which sucks.|13|Catan

33096|HuskerJD|7.9|"Great overall game, good for group interaction.  Concept and strategy are very good with multiple and dynamic paths to victory.  Games are usually balanced but lopsided ones happen occasionally.  Dice rolling means a small luck factor, but it's strategic enough that a few bad rolls won't break you.  Highly replayable.  Trading aspect is interesting also and means very little downtime during other players' turns.  The fact that gamers and non-gamers alike enjoy it is a big plus also (""no, not another movie... how about a game of Settlers?"").  The cost of expansions and the possibility of a player being blocked off early in the game keep this from a higher rating.  BGG users have suggested several good variations for this one."|13|Catan
33097|Hierax|7.9|"B+   Very Good Game (like to play and never will turn it down).  One of the Best ""Gateway Games"" to get non-gamers to play games. Pretty much everyone who plays it loves it.  The simple elegance of these rules is superior to the more complicated mechanics of ""Cities and Knights"" and ""Seafarers"". The only improved versions are the ""Trojan War"" and ""Wall of China"" variants."|13|Catan

""Take That"" cards still annoy me to this day, but they're pretty downplayed in settlers.  I definitely should give this game a few more spins.  Apr 08: The elegance is finally getting to me.  My thoughts wander to the simple economy and the beauty of it all.  I will definitely be playing this more in the future."|13|Catan

33195|EbbeC|7.9|These days it feels too random, but considering I haven't played any game as much as this one, and still enjoy a game now and then, this needs to be rated high. It is an absolute classic. The dice rolls can make or break your game, but there is strategy involved to mitigate some of that.   This is a game that is extremely easy to teach someone and is a great way to nudge someone into the hobby.|13|Catan

33200|ArborBarber|7.9|It's hard for me to comprehend that this game is not rated higher. It's perhaps the reason for all of this that you see around you. For most Americans, this is the reason we don't associate board games with risk and monopoly.   That said, Catan is the high school girlfriend that you remember fondly but have moved on from. You might still make out with her when you're home for the holidays, but otherwise you'd rather mack on the classier college girls with their lower back tattoos and PBR.|13|Catan

33231|stimberg|7.8|good breezy game tho i find myself a year into playing it craving depth -- a bit luck-driven. esp good with non-gamers. i prefer with cities and knights expansion. |13|Catan
33232|MonkeyDLuffy|7.8|I only occasionally suggest to play this, but I will always say yes to an offer to play it and enjoy it. So definitely between a 7 and 8 on the scale, leaning towards the 8 end.  It's not a brain burner, but it does require both light strategy and light tactics.  Negotiation/wheedling skill can be a large factor, but I haven't ever seen the game totally thrown by one player being particularly good at cajoling others.  This luck factor in this game tends to be blown out of proportion rather frequently here at the BGG.  Yes there are dice rolls involved, but the game gives you plenty of opportunities to mitigate the effect on you, if you wind up far behind and out of the game once then it may have been die rolls.  Twice in a row, then it probably is a bad strategy not a 'luck' issue.|13|Catan

A true classic that brought a lot of people to modern boardgames. That said, it feels rather dated now. The winner is often decided as much by the dice as by strategy, which can be frustrating to experienced gamers. It is still worth re-visiting occasionally though. Star Trek Catan, with its character-specific abilities, is a nice improvement on the original design.|13|Catan

33486|bmun|7.75|This will always hold a special place. It's a timeless classic that has its share of flaws, but it really has helped bring a lot of people into modern board gaming. It's fun to play once in a blue moon, especially as a gateway for non-gamers and new gamers. It's tense with hoping for certain resource numbers to appear, racing to take space before your opponents, and pushing your luck with hand size limits and the robber. It's interactive through negotiating trade with your opponents and through the building race.  To help mitigate the overly swingy luck factor that I find to be the biggest flaw, I like to use a stack of cards with perfect probability distribution instead of dice, and also a board setup calculated for fairness by the Better Settlers website. (Side note:  I had a friend who was opposed to this deliberate balancing saying it was out of the spirit of the game, but then the game we played ended up with final scores of 9-9-9-10. I have never seen a 4 player game so close! Everyone was one turn away from victory.) The kingmaking aspect can get a little mean, so hopefully players don't take it personally.|13|Catan

33579|rtugui|7.7|The best game for you if you don't play board games. Friends and girls love it. Best trading and social game so far (if you let it). Never get mad to the dice. Just have fun playing. A little to much luck but you can use some variants to put it in check. I advise you 2 new house rules:  If you don't receive any resource, place a token (Catan doesn't come with any, so add them to the game) in front of you. Once you have x tokens equal to your points, trade it (on your turn) for any resource. Tokens can't be stolen and don't count as cards in your hand.  If the same number (besides 7) rolls again (two times in a row), you MUST add or subtract, a value of 2, to the number (you choose, but can't never use a value of just 1). This rule is inspired from Elasund.|13|Catan

33742|Jmclean27|7.6|This is a great game! I wouldn't turn down a game of it if asked. It's different every time you play but this is more of a lucky game that let's you think you are in control and that strategy is involved. You make decisions that's true, but most of the time the decision you make is obvious or the only choice you have. This game I know very well and may that's part of my problem, the unpredictable random nature of the dice role is too random? This game does escalate well if not evenly and the race for the final few points is enjoyed by one or two at most. .. often the other players have been left behind and for them the game ended a few rounds ago. Still for all my nit picking complaints...I wouldn't turn down a game.... is that this games magic?  |13|Catan

33795|VeteranVandal|7.55|"I liked the game when I played it a long time ago, but the fact that I played a lot better games made this one stop here. I don't have too much nostalgia about it since I ALWAYS, SINCE THE FIRST GAME disliked a feature that is not only prominent here, but also something other games LOVE doing, and in its essence is what I dislike in Scythe, Kemet, GoT and here (there are other games I played in this list with a similar sudden endgame condition that EITHER give players at least a ""salvage round"" to cushion the disaster for the players not ending the game or make this a ): sudden endgame conditions. It can be tied to a score of sorts (8VP in Kemet's case, 10VP in Catan's case, 6th star in Scythe's case) and doesn't give the rest of the players a chance to do anything, resulting in a frustrating endgame condition.  I never liked those. I think they are a cheap (while easy) design feature made in lazy manner. I tend to like games giving the ""consolation round"" WAY more, since, at the very least they give the player some agency in what to do in their last round (it usually doesn't change spectacularly the endgame placement, but at least gives the player that last chance of achieving something)."|13|Catan

Not the ""greatest game ever"" as many claim, but it is fun, easy to learn, and got me introduced me to ""German Style"" games.  Game is great in its basic form or coupled with the available expansions (Knights & Cities is the best in my opinion). One thing I don't care for, the amount of luck involved in the die rolls for resources.  But, I guess it all evens out in the end.  Give this game a try!"|13|Catan

33934|reapersaurus|7.5|(Initial comments: ) I don't get all the love for this game. It's too dependant on rolls. If you don't get good rolls to acquire resources, you can't do much as a player. The 7-high card limitation leads to some players getting screwed repeatedly.  (Multiple replays through the years have upped the score from a 5 to a 7.5 I still think it's over-liked, but as a historical game that can bring in non-gamers to a wider world of gaming, it could even warrant another .5 point)  10/30/14 Picked up a complete unplayed 4th edition copy at Goodwill for $3.99|13|Catan

34013|Starsunsky|7.5|[Mayfair third edition w/ pre-2007 adapter kit] {Catan, Civilization, gateway; trading, modular-board, development, dice-rolling, resource management; optimal 3p} Settlers of Catan is a decent family game with a strong development theme. It is fun and exciting. The game flow is very smooth and has less down time. It's not a heavy strategy game but it provides many tactical options. It is of good player interaction from the trading, robber and the competition of roads. The dice rolling, though luck-driven, adds excitement to the game.  It has several novel mechanics - dynamic board, rolls for production, etc, which have been re-used in many other games.  Beginners' setup should be used when introducing this game to your friends. No matter how you remind them, they will easily overlook the importance of initial placement of settlements and priority of resources at different stages of the game. They will then feel desperate that they are blocked from the game. |13|Catan

34066|paulclarke339|7.5|Good trading and gateway game. Some replay value, but gets boring if you play it too much. I burned out on this when I took it to Australia. I took a bit of a break from this game in 2005/2006 academic year, but since Autumn 06 I got back into it, then burned out again, and doubt I'll be keen to play it again since I realised how high the randomness really is. Also it is slightly too long. The game can get boring if your numbers aren't coming up.  Settlers is best with 4. 3 or 5 means it's too easy to expand, 5-6 is too slow. I think the expansions all make the game worse.  It was my first Euro. I also now realise that there is too much luck - early luck gets compounded, and players can be out of contention after 10 minutes (or 0 minutes if they put their 2 settlements in stupid places). Also it is kind of the same every time - there's only a few ways to get points so you end up doing the same things every game. Or every few games I suppose: you might get longest road one game, and largest army + VP cards the next, but there's not much strategy space to explore. Funny I'm saying this now, when I first played it I was impressed by all those multiple paths to victory.  Another issue I have is that 50% of the skill/important decisions in the game are the setup initial placement. After that the dice tell you what you should be building. The trading phase keeps me engaged because you have to pay attention and negotiate with the other players (that's the best part of the game), the robber and competition for longest road are good aspects.  These days when I see a bunch of Settlers-ers setting up, I like to watch the initial placement and then predict who will win based on resource access. More often than not I am right.

34102|rmiczek|7.5|this game is simple but a good introduction to euro type games.  Combines trading with with area control in a easy to understand package.  I gotten many non-gamers to play this.  There is a bit of a run away problem if the die rolls don't work out to get you resources  and there is no catch up mechanic but just keep up if you can.  Games can also run a little long for what it is.|13|Catan
34103|atholbrose|7.5|"Wow. Game boxes used to be so ... drab!  It's brown with some brown on it. Yawn. The game is still the same though.  After not playing Settlers for ten years or so, and playing it 4 times in a month, I think I'm a bit Settler'd out. It's a good game, but it's definitely been surpassed (for me) in complexity and fun by later games.  UPDATE: I think I've identified what ""gets me"" about Settlers. If you are the player that falls behind -- and there's almost always a player that falls behind -- there is very little you can do to dig your way out of the hole you're in. In the rare game that doesn't have this happen -- like the game I played tonight, which ended with 9-8-7 points -- the game is a fun contest all the way through, but boy does it suck to be the pre-destined loser.  4/2012: Updated rating to be more realistic. Settlers is still quite a good game, even if it's not one I want to play a lot of."|13|Catan

34167|chrisnd|7.5|"This is one of my favorites to bring out when there are 3 or 4 players at my house.  An excellent game that involves a touch of strategy, a forward-thinking perspective, and a lot of player interaction.  I only use the Event Cards for this - I think it speeds the game up by quite a bit, as there is the possibility with a few of the cards to reward EVERYONE playing with a resource card - which is usually a good thing.  This is one of the few games out there that can be played ""AS IS"".  What I mean by that is that there is no need for any house rules or other variants.  It is a very well balanced and finely designed game that does not need tweaking or modifications to make it play ""better"".  Not saying that is bad, but if you don't like to have to keep track of a bunch of house rules (Monopoly, Descent, etc.), then this game is perfect for you.  This game is also single-handedly responsible for the worst one-line cliche in all of gamedom - ""I have wood for your sheep.""  Although it is still funny to say, even if you aren't a Beavis and Butthead type fan."|13|Catan

34314|McHaka|7.5|This game would be very good if it wasn't a piece of painful agony from the very beginning to the latest move. Okay, it's not painful if you happen to be lucky, but for somebody it is. Results will get balanced in the long run, but because the game takes so long to play, you're not willing to see the long run, ever.  Do NOT buy any extensions. They only make the game unnecessary complex, long, and even more torturing.|13|Catan

34321|jetaudio77|7.5|A solid and fun game and can be quite tense towards the end of the game. Lots of player interaction and the robber can often prevent runaway leader problems.  There is a huge hidden strategic element in this game. So far it seems that trying to trade a lot is a great strategy towards winning along with trying to get your settlements on different numbers as opposed to getting a few big numbers to cut down on robber screwage.|13|Catan

I like the fact that you can create your own board. One issue: luck, after numerous plays it kind of bugged me, but still it is a must-have.

I like randomness in my games, but the particular interaction between luck and skill in Settlers can just be frustrating.  I mean, it's been three turns since I've seen a new resource, and, oh look another 7!  I really like the variant where you reroll 7's for the first round.  Honestly just playing this sparingly enough makes it a better game :)|13|Catan

Like the trading aspect and like the building.  Made better by Cities and Knights.  Update Jan 2015: Played this game with my brothers over Christmas.  Awesome.  Simple enough for everyone to come up to speed quickly and liquor-fueled trading interaction was great.  And I really like how the development cards provided another path to victory if someone was locked out of building cities.  This game is classic and should be the game the general population points to when they think of ""boardgames"" and relegate Monopoly to the dustbin of history."|13|Catan

34829|MaroonedMorlock|7.5|Nice game to initiate people to non-monopoly board games and lure them into the board gaming arena.  I played a bit too much of that game, but I may still play it when people do not want to learn more complicated games or I do not feel like explaining yet another game (yeah, I'm the rule explainer).  Retains a good score because I too was led back into boardgaming by Catan. Thanks for that!|13|Catan

34857|lbleicher|7.5|While I can't stress enough how important this game is for our hobby, I have to admit the biggest reason for my recent plays was the fact that it used to be my wife's favorite game. But in our last play, even she was a bit bored. While I still enjoy it occasionally, my assigned gateways would be, in that order, Modern Art, Fearsome Floors, Carcassonne, Stone Age and Ticket to Ride.  Catan was the poster child for what the (classic) Euros did well, one important feature being keeping playing time reasonable. It was quite obvious for those who, like me, grew up playing stuff like Monopoly or Risk, but twenty years later it seems to last a bit too long for what it is (a light family game with some luck). A nice, simple idea to improve the game is simply to let each player place a city and a settlement (instead of two settlements) when the game starts, Not only this means there are now only 7 more points to achieve rather than 8, but also that the early game isn't so slow due to people not getting enough resources.|13|Catan

35148|NonProfitGnome|7.5|(After 5 Plays) 10/12/16: Catan is a game I enjoy quite a bit. It was one of the first games I played (like many others on the site), but I don't like it simply for nostalgias sake. There is some real strategy here. Yes, there is randomness which some wont like but it doesn't take away from the fun. Its a game that is light enough to just enjoy your time with it win or lose. It has been surpassed by other games which is why its score has dipped some but its one I'm always willing to play.|13|Catan

35171|TLHobbes|7.5|I'm liking this game more and more over time. My wife and I have tried many 2-player variants but they never pan out terribly well. It's a lot of fun with 3 or 4 players. For me, the meat of the game tends to be in the initial setup (placement of first two settlements). Sometimes the dice just hate you. But in all that chaos, there are multiple adaptive strategies.|13|Catan

35394|TeeGally|7.5|My first love in board gaming. It's lost some of its luster over the years as I've discovered so many other amazing games. My main issue with it is that it's very possible to have a game become an exercise in frustration because the dice aren't rolling in your favor - and there's just nothing you can do about it. I'm ready to try some house rules to try to prevent that.|13|Catan

However, it can also get really frustrating, and I have seen some people get pretty mad when their road gets cut off (or something equally trivial).   I think my rating has also been skewed some by the ""this is a 'really light, introductory game' to the game boarding world, and thus it doesn't deserve a high rating"" mentality.  In any case, I have only played it once in the last two years. Whether it is because of how I personally feel, or how those who play with me feel, this does need to be reflected in the rating I give."|13|Catan

35501|Gaius|7.5|"In my opinion, Settlers of Catan is quickly becoming one of 'the' new classics of the modern gaming age.  This is a perfect gateway game for those that lived on Monopoly and Life and want to take their board game experience to a new level.  That being said, you can only play this game so many dozens of times before it gets old.  Luckily, Mayfair Games gave us expansions.  To remove some of the luck aspect, I highly recommend this rule from the expansions: whenever a production roll results in a player receiving no resources (except on a ""7""), that player receives 1 gold.  2 gold can be traded for one resource of the player's choice during their turn."|13|Catan

I complain a little bit about the luck element, as sometimes the dice seem to favor unlikely numbers, but usually it evens out. I also like the fact that there are several ways to try to score victory points. Watch out for that guy buying up all those development cards!|13|Catan

35899|Sly master9|7.5|The great classic. Probably the first game people think of nowadays after relics like Monopoly, Classic Risk and Cluedo.  + It is satisfying to slowly expand your civilisation and see your settlers thrive. + Easy too learn, hard to master.  + The gathering of resources and using them in specific combinations to build seems mundane now, but every other game that does this partly builds on the legacy of SoC.  +/- a few of the problems with the game can be fixed with expansions. (Seafarers makes wool worth more, Fishermen makes coastal settlements less of a waste)  - The runtime can be too long if people take too long negotiating. - It is a tad too luckheavy for my tastes. If the dice are not on your side you won't have anything to do in your turn.   It's still part of my 'introduction trinity' with Pandemic and Ticket to Ride|13|Catan

By playing this game with somebody who doesn't play board games You can show that They can do something more than throwing dice/pushing pawn and yet it's doesn't need to be hard/boring/pointless. The game can be played with 2-4 players (where 3 players is optimal between spacial and crowded), takes about 60-90 minutes. The game is charming and fun but after couple of plays You might want to go for something more complex.|13|Catan

36136|Riotgirl|7.5|Previously played Catan online many years back a lot (a LOT!), and decided to buy a physical copy for my playing group which consists of my partner, my family and/or her family, and my friend (who is a gamer) for the following reasons:  1. Good components - components are excellent, and the hexagonal map is modular allowing for different set-ups each time [variability]  2. Mechanics - well thought out and put together, which work really well with the theme, and more importantly has a fair degree of player interaction even during other players turns  3. Simple and logical rules - concise and build upon the theme and mechanics. Very cohesive  4. Interaction - fair degree of player interaction through trading, blocking roads, and moving the robber  It may be fashionable in some quarters to bash Settlers for its success and market penetration, it still holds up as a worthwhile game (unless you detest any form of luck in games), is still relevant, worthwhile, and fun to play now.   Catan is no longer an automatic shoe-in as the default gateway game (testament to the vast range of excellent games available), however it is a worthwhile choice as a gateway game. One that I still enjoy playing on occasion.|13|Catan

36217|embattisti|7.5|The classic that got me into tabletop gaming. Probably more of a nostalgia rating than overall play rating, but still always willing to go back and play more.

36219|corbybender|7.5|After playing on and off for years on various phone/tablets, I broke down and bought the board game to play with my kids.  It's too heady for my 5-year-old, but both my 7 and 10 year old daughters enjoyed it.  The game, which runs a little longer than some of our favorites (Forbidden Island, Ticket To Ride) was perfect for myself and the 10-year-old.  The 7-year-old had a good time but was a bit jacked up during play.  I'm not sure if it was because she was losing interest or just being 7.  Either way, we completed the first game and I got a thumb's up from both kids.    Update, in future game plays, both the 7 and 10 year old had a good time.  Once they fully understood the game, what it takes to win, and could estimate how much time was left (because the youngest gets a bit bored), it became more enjoyable.  Since they like this game, I'm thinking Stone Age will be our next purchase.|13|Catan

While learning the game is simple, the strategy has depths to it that grow as the players better understand the consequences of their choices.

There's a lot of luck involved, which can be frustrating but also can make for memorable games and really dramatic moments. For a more ""even"" game, it's easy to swap in a card deck for die rolls but I feel like the game loses some charm this way. Annoyingly, in a game where the ideal choice is usually fairly obvious, there tends to be a lot of analysis paralysis when newer players know they can work out the odds but take a long time to do so. Having a ""longest turn"" card which subtracts VPs is a great addition when everyone has similar levels of experience with the game."|13|Catan

36451|b_dobbs|7.5|One of the first Euro-style games I've played, and it is still one of the best introductory board games out there. It offers a great balance of luck and skill – but that isn't to say the dice can completely ruin a game's fun.  I love that the game offers a way to mitigate the amount of luck involved by allowing players the opportunity to spread their settlements across all options, granting them access to each of the possible die rolls. Trading is fun and keeps players interacting with one another.   The modular board creates a new game every time.  Really, this game covers a lot of aspects that are present in hundreds of Euro-style games. If I have a friend who wants to get into board games, I will almost always introduce them to this one first.   |13|Catan

Hunting down a copy of the Seafarers expansion now. Feels good to be excited with this game again. It's a one of a king experience and am glad that my g/f talked me into keeping it. More to come after I try Seafarers.|13|Catan

36504|Zafin|7.5|I added this to my collection in June of 2010. This was the first game I played of the more modern games. It led me from the world of Risk, Monopoly, Clue, Life, and other classic games to a whole new world. The map is random and changes each time you play it. Build roads to expand your influence and built more towns. The dice determine the game play but there is some strategy involved. Trade with other players but be careful not to have too many resources or you may have to give some up if someone rolls a 7. Focus on getting the longest road or building the largest army. Winner is the first person to 10 points. Great 1.5 hour to 2 hour game for beginners. Seasoned players may take 1 to 1.5 hours. Played well with 3-6 players. |13|Catan

36527|soundsnaive|7.5|My favourite aspect is the negotiations. I haven’t seen that a lot in resource management/engine building games. Catan does everything else pretty well. The dice rolling keeps it light and fun, but a streak of poor rolls can be frustrating because it is a competitive game that can go a little long.  Collection: Dispensable |13|Catan

Es ist auch heute noch ein tolles Spiel und kann sich gegen moderne Vertreter durchaus behaupten. Und wer diesen Klassiker noch nie gespielt hat, sollte das unbedingt nachholen.Viele Mechaniken, die heute fast schon ""Standard"" sind, wurden hier eingeführt. Der Eine oder Andere wird sich eventuell am hohen Glücksfaktor (Würfelwurf = Ressourcenvergabe) stören, trotzdem wird ""Siedler"" ein Spiel sein, was man auch in 10 oder 20 Jahren noch auf den Tisch bringen wird."|13|Catan

36721|EricGamesInSanfordFL|7.5|"Bought the game and 4-6 player expansion for $50-$70 (I forget) MANY years ago. After many games, I started to keep a Hall Of Fame paper where we recorded: Game Length, # of Players, Who won and what position did they place, and Least and Most common Dice Roll #. We have 91 games that we kept record of on the HOF (I won 41 of them :) ). I have played over 100 games of Catan. This has been one of the best game purchases I've ever made.   BUT, that was years ago. Back then, this game was a 10 easy. Now, with the way games are changing and new mechanics being created, I'd say it's a 7. We still play it, but it doesn't get chosen many times (perhaps because we've played it so many times).  Couple notes: My gaming group and family aren't big fans of chance, luck/lack of luck, or ganging up on. Therefore, most of the time we played without trading. This was mainly to stop bad players from giving the person winning what they needed to win... Too many times I'd be winning and I'd convince a silly player to trade me a terrible trade and game over. It's not much fun when that happens.  Another variant we did was, we played a lot of game (maybe 50%) without the thief. If you rolled a 7, you just picked someone to steal from.   Another variant we ALWAYS played with, and I think this helps the game, is that you could negotiate. If you're about to be stolen from, you can ask the thief ""what do you want?"" He says ""wood"", you hand him a wood and thus protect your other precious resources. OR he says ""wood"" and you need wood, so you say ""good luck"" and then he picks randomly. This addition was always nice to have.   When we played with the thief, you could negotiate with the thief and say, ""I'll give you what you want IF you block my 12 and not my 6"" etc... this rule is also great. Everyone is happy. Of course sometimes the thief says, ""nice try"" and just smacks the thief down on your 6 that has 3 cities on it. BOOM.  So, if you haven't played the game before. Get it. Play it. You'll enjoy it. I don't think you'll get 100 games out of it like I did, but you'll get some good mileage on it."|13|Catan

36732|Lv20Commoner|7.5|A great game to have a couple over and play during a conversation.  It's either Ticket to Ride or this for that purpose.  Sometimes I'd rather roll dice.  I didn't have this years ago so it hasn't lost its charm.|13|Catan
36733|Ultra Poopsy|7.5|A great game that keeps hitting the table for it's simplicity and easy set up. This is the gateway game for new board game groups. Highly addicting initially, and still a good time after many plays. There's a lot of luck and it can be frustrating when your resources are not rolled or when you get hopelessly blocked in. A good strategy will only take you so far. I suppose this is what makes it good and fair for experienced and new gamers. If you like it and want an expansion then the best one is Catan Cities and Knights hands down. You don't need any other expansion and in fact many of them don't combine well.|13|Catan
36734|tuned2g|7.5|Pros: gateway strategy game, network building integrated with resource management, direct player interaction with trading mechanic, variable board set-up, high replayability  Cons: high level of luck, trading mechanism sometimes falls flat  Like so many other people, this was my gateway game to REAL board games. After so many years, it is still one of the first considerations for game night!|13|Catan

36742|maklen9|7.5|For myself and many others, Catan was the 'gateway drug' that got me immersed into the hobby of strategic board games after previously only being exposed to overplayed 'Classics' like Monopoly or Risk, party games like Cranium and Trivial Pursuit, or a couple of complicated war games that took an entire day to play if you were lucky.  Catan (or Settlers of Catan when I first played it) hits a lot of key areas for a great board game - easy to understand and teach rules, excellent replayability with the board being different for each game, relatively short time period with games averaging 45-60 minutes, a variety of potential strategies and paths to victory, a lot of player interaction with trading, and gameplay that typically keeps all players with a shot at victory up to the very end. The only real knock against Catan may be it's theme - which can be a little vague (I guess it's early Medieval settlers on a newly discovered island??) and not necessarily the most appealing - and can feel a little tacked on (there's a reason why there are so many alternative versions of Catan - like Star Trek Catan).  But overall, this is an excellent game board game that is easily accessible to casual board-gamers and is definitely an essential part of any collection.  Adding to its value, there are also a variety of expansions that layer additional elements on top of the basic set.  By far the best expansion is Cities and Knights, which practically transforms Catan to a different game - while maintaining the same core mechanics.|13|Catan

36781|IllNate|7.5|Still a good game. Replayability is high, but it suffers from low player interaction (besides blocking & trading). Another major drawback is that the losing player can fall out fast, especially if they've been cut off. And in fact they can have no hope of winning early on. The mechanics are solid however and so many better games have been built upon this one. 10 when i first bought it, 9 in 2006. Talk about a game that stands the test of time though. Still a good game to introduce your friends to gaming.|13|Catan

The lack of theme is what kills it for me (also the hate-trading)  But I am sure I will continue to play this one.  It is a classic.|13|Catan

Predefined placements and pips for statistical likelihood help.  -1 For whatever reason, this game seems to lead to more saltiness and hurt feelings than other games. Possibly the bluntness of the mechanics, possibly the fact that 'entirely do my own thing' is only an option for so long/if at all.   A classic for a reason.

This game has its flaws, (opening settlement placements are like half the game, it's slow, makes people go on tilt) but still plays well. When it is good, it is really good. When it is bad... well... the fact that is still a family staple is a testament to how good it is.|13|Catan

37292|manutd03|7.4|Usually fun, interesting combo of luck and strategy.    The randomness of the die rolls usually leads to one player getting screwed every game, regardless of that player's skill level.  When you happen to be that player, it's a frustrating game.  If not, it can be a lot of fun.  The variable board is excellent.  Sometimes we use the official dice deck instead of rolling, and/or play that 2 and 12 activate each other.  Not a fan of the sea pieces in the 4th ed. Mine don't lay flat, which is sort of annoying.    [i]*Own 5-6 player extension.[/i]|13|Catan

37312|norgano|7.4|Nice light euro game. One of the prime examples probably. Better trading game than most games that rely on trading.  update: bumped from 7 to 7.4. The game is worthy of most of it's hype and popularity. I still don't like rolling for resources. It doesn't feel right for Euro or Ameritrash or anything in between. It's just annoying.

In my opinion perfect balance between luck and skill, a new player can in some cases beat a more experienced one but strategy and tactics still makes big diffrence. Almost no downtime thanks to the production mechanic where you get to draw cards and trade in other player turns. Player interaction mechanics through the bandit, trade and area control works really good.   RATING: Theme 5 Gameplay 9 Rulebook 8 Components 5 Funfactor 8.5 Value 8.5 Average 7.3|13|Catan

[b]1.4.10 Update:[/b] After being confined to a shelf for the past few years, our most recent play found this classic has lost some of it's glow. It's still a great game, but when compared to some of the newer games, this just takes way too long to set up/play/tear down for the return in enjoyment.

37594|kevinwho|7.25|A modern classic, involving planning, negotiation, and a bit of chance. I'm not really fond of the trading aspect, but as long as you're not playing with people who constantly try to cajole you into making unfavorable trades, or people who just make any trade they're offered to be nice, it works fine in Settlers.  Expansions add flavor but also length. Usually not a worthwhile trade-off for my tastes. If you fall behind in the base game, the end is not so far away, if you fall behind when using expansions, a significant portion of your life passes while you wait for the end.|13|Catan

Up to that point I had no idea about the existance of similar games. The flexibility in being able to mix several expansions and create your own worlds is fantastic.  The only negative is that in a 3/4 player game there is always one player far behind the others, and their game is over relatively quickly.|13|Catan

37712|Deleted010518|7.2|2008-04-05   Dave Loved the game and pushed for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th game - all with the basic setup but swapping colours for the 3rd/4th.  We all won once, Dave also winning a 2nd time.  The trading is the main means of interaction but being able to block off opponents' settlements and striving to win the Longest road card  Luck is a strong factor in deciding the victor, but I think a better player would win more times.   Strong similarities to Monopoly - the shared board, gathering cards, trading, the 'building an empire' theme - but with tons of advantages (trading more strongly necessiated by the mechanics, opportunities to take down the leader, no knockouts)... I can understand why this game was the one to introduce Eurogaming to America.  Incidentally, the board was slightly bent and caused much aggro.|13|Catan

Edit June 2013: Played a couple of games today with friends who had never played before. Great fun, but with my slightly more mature gaming palate it's obvious that a) you can lose before the game starts, depending upon placement of your initial settlements, and b) there is a significant random componant than can be frustrating. Enjoyable regardless.|13|Catan

37792|Ma3dhros|7.2|This was my Gateway Game. Played nearly 100 times since 2007 and will still play when asked. Since expanding my horizons, I have a hard time accepting that most of the game you are relying on random outcomes based on your placements, but everyone is in the same boat (albeit with different random outcomes that they want, some are better than others) so it's fine.  Asking for wood never gets old either.  The game is easy to teach and easy to play, I understand how it can be such a good intro game (or even a casual game).   Expansions are nice as well - I like Cities and Knights and would prefer to play that variant all the time. Unfortunately it is difficult to add these new rules with the people who I play Catan with.   On a regular night with my group, this game would not come out.

I don't even care if I win; I just want to build up my villages and get more resources. If I get all the numbers, I consider myself the winner. Enjoyable to most people, everyone should own this game.|13|Catan

Si uno sólo lo ve desde esa perspectiva es un juego que divierte y cumple, si uno lo valora con otros juegos que uno juega con grupo más experimentados, claramente pierde puntos.

37985|Wight1984|7.1|I find myself neglecting Catan in favour of newer and more shiny games, but it really is a classic.  It's not that it's the best game or my favourite game, but (along with Carcassonne and Ticket to Ride) it feels a bit like the Monopoly or Risk of the modern generation of games.  It's got a fair bit of luck, but also a fair bit of choice - it's not a 'heavy' game that will go on for hours, but you do have a sense of building something and your island will look differently at the end (and start) of each game.  It's a good solid game.|13|Catan

Sometimes enjoyment can be subject to dice rolls OR whether or not people at your table are willing to barter.   -Components - 7 I have the Catan version from 1904 (or something like that) and even then they understood the important of Wooden bits! I've never seen sexier Octagons (Hexagons? Decagons?) I can't remember how many sides there are off the top of my head. Sue me.   -""Tableability"" - 7 Easy, peezy, lemon squeezy. Set it up ahead of time for -1 to your potential new game friends intimidation level.   -Eagerness to Replay - 7 This game has been banned from the table by the last group I played with, apparently they didn't like the monoply I established on sheep. I told them it was my baaaaaaaaaad, they weren't as amused as me. I'd like to play again. Hey you, yea you, will you play Catan with me?  -Mechanics - 6.9999 Sometimes you love it, the other times the dice work against you. Even my wooden dice from the 1800s still hate me sometimes. There was a time when I would have given a dice chucker a 9 or so, but I've seen the world and I'm an enlightened man now.   "|13|Catan

38020|Vectis99|7.1|A very weird mix of a party game and a strategic board control game. This mix does more harm than good mechanically, making it very easy for tensions to inflame as a lot of the players butt heads with each other over the distinction between arbitrary jokes and strategic bullying, leading to an aggressive play experience for certain sorts of people. Nevertheless, played in the right setting with the right mindset, Catan is a ton of fun.

38296|Fue|7.0|It's hard to score this game as although its gameplay value is beyond dispute, the level of inherent randomness is way too high for most players. As a result, once every player is in possession of the fundamental skills needed to play, the winner is pretty much decided by the roll of the dice. Try substituting cards for the dice to cut down on the luck factor.  On the other hand, this game is just so much plain old fun that it is hard for me (and everyone else) to keep from playing from time to time. Just don't take it too seriously. This game is never followed by sessions of analyzing who did what wrong or right, if you know what I mean. Real solid games are almost always followed up by such discussions in our group. This is not such a game.|13|Catan

38671|shugyosha|7.0|A classic.  Like many, I cut my teeth on German games with this and I have played it the most times of any of them.  It has its faults - a bad choice at the beginning can make for a long and painful game and I have rarely seen a game so able to bring the Whiner out in everyone (myself included!).  But for all this, it still regularly comes to the table and is welcomed.  Still fun to play after many games.  UPDATE: downgraded to 7 from 8.  I will still happily play this game (provided I haven't played it too much recently) but I won't suggest it.  Though it is a classic, there are better games, games in which you can actually do something on every turn, where a poor run of dice rolls don't leave you out of the game.  I really want more involvement in my gaming, but I will still play basic Settlers.  Expansions however I am less enthusiastic...|13|Catan

The game's biggest draw for us is the player interaction - players gain resources out of turn if their numbers come up.

But with experienced players it flies by, those things tend to even out over time, and you can learn to mitigate bad luck (to an extent).  The caprice of the dice is part of the charm, IMHO.  A great gateway to the hobby for many, this is the game my group broke out when we last expanded...it's sort of a baseline game for ""gamers"", giving the opportunity for some easy sociable play.  My kids have learned to love this game, too, and the fact that they can grow up with this rather than Monopoly means a lot to me."|13|Catan

38815|SCROOGE|7.0|What can anyone say about this game? I think that every board gamer should own it...You will always find people to play it and love it...The only disadvantages of the game are 1.the 4th and sometimes the 3rd place in the middle of the game are obvious and almost withdrawn from competition (they get bored...) basically due to 2. The starting positions are extremely crucial and if you make a mistake or you are cut off it's almost impossible to win and 3. Only 4 players can play it. Ok these disadvantages seem little serious but all in all the game is GREAT. Fun, arguments, strategic play, screwing others and negotiations guarantee a pleasant time, satisfaction in the end and multiple plays in the future...

38835|CortexBomb|7.0|"My first German game, the allure died off only after two months of regular full day (read noon to the wee hours, we had sessions ending at 5 AM for a while there) play sessions with everyone I know and I have easily logged over 100 games of this. I still enjoy dragging this out every once in a while. Siedler mainly has a niche for the very casual atmosphere it creates, plenty of time for table talk, banter, and such during the game, one of the reasons it has such broad cross-over appeal methinks. I made the mistake of playing this with a deck of dice for a period of time, essentially trying to turn this into something that it shouldn't be, I'm back to the dice again, and the game has been getting some more play.  This game is interesting in that unlike most modern gateway games, it is actually very prone to position-destroying mistakes when you first set up the board and stake your initial claim. Most people who like it tend to play it a fair bit, especially when they first get it, and in that setting the random boards and initial set-up are a good deal of the allure, but it does tend to make the game a bit dicey when you mix ""serious"" gamers with newer players, as it is very easy to sink yourself with a poor initial placement and end up sitting around for the game doing a lot of nothing because of that. I would go so far as to say that the initial placement is at least half of the game, with another 1/4 being trading skills and board play and the final 1/4 being luck of the roll and development draw. Take it for what it's worth. I probably wouldn't like it as much as I do if I played it for the first time today, but I do have fond memories of this one and still enjoy pulling it out on occasion with the right group."|13|Catan

The die-roll mechanic for determining what is harvested can be cruelly unforgiving (even if you hedge by placing settlements adjacent to as many different numbers as possible). We've tried the event cards and our initial reaction is positive. But, for a fairly quick empire-building game involving trading and luck - it's fun.

39176|jayjonbeach|7.0|"Civilization:City building:Resource Management:Trading:Negoiation  100  plays (most were computer version or online): Very addicting game in the discovery stage even though it is mostly luck dependant, especially when playing with equally skilled players. This is a classic example of how luck and dice do not automatically mean the game will be bad or broken, it is one of the main reasons the game is so fun but it can also get occasionally frustrating when the dice work against you. Expansions add a few more choices/decisions but the C&K is the only one worth the money and sometimes regular Settlers is really all you want. Rating this fairly high due to high fun factor and that ""let's play again feeling"", also this has high replay value and a few paths to Victory. My theory is the ""greed"" aspect of it is why it's so fun as well as ""take that"" when cutting off your opponet's road.  [u]UPDATE[/u]: After 100 plays this fell a little from a 9 but only a classic could see 100 plays and my rating won't ever fall below 8.5 even though it doesn't see much play now. It also gains extra points for it's ""uncanny"" ability to win over non-gamers to the hobby and we found some ways to play with 2 players as well.   [u]UPDATE[/u]:8.5 => 7.5 What can I say, after playing a lot more other games I now don't like playing this much (mostly due to the high luck factor), it especially becomes too long for what it is with 4 people. If you are new(ish) to the hobby this is still a great choice."|13|Catan

39268|weasel|7.0|OK, I finally played my first game of Settlers. It was the 2 player variant where you play to 15 and roll the resource dice twice. Anyway, I liked it a lot. We'll definitely play again.  My only problem with the game so far is that I am red/green color deficient. So all those reds and browns and greens are a little rough to tell apart. Although there is some detail on the cards it's not high contrast so it doesn't help much. Also - it would help if there were pictures on each tile of the resource that the tile produces. It was hard for me to just look at a tile and know what resource was associated with it. I had to keep looking at the resource cards and then try to figure out which background matched the tile. Ugh. |13|Catan

39382|cktjharris|7.0|When I first opened up the box, I was intimidated by all the rulebooks.  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the gameplay is not complicated.  The game makes interesting use of dice roll statistics, although this can be frustrating too.  Players doing well tend to keep doing better; it can be tough to catch up.  But there always seems to be at least one elusive resource for each player.  We have played with 3 players, with 6 players (with the expansion), and with the second 2-player variant listed on Mayfair's website (each player plays only one color).  We greatly prefer the game with more than 2, since that allows players to trade cards with each other.|13|Catan
39383|aweber|7.0|Luck.  Stupid 9's (or whatever it happens to be any given day).  What sucks is that your destiny is tied so directly to dice.  Like monopoly or candyland.  Even risk does not seems so bad-luck cruel.  Still, Settlers is fun in spite of the dice.  In the end my biggest problem with settlers is not the dice directly, but the lack of viable long term strategy.  This is another per-turn optimization game.  For some unknown reason, as much as I hate its problems, I'll keep playing it.|13|Catan

Baffled as to why they keep meddling with the English art, as the German/original is still the best, hasn't changed, and they don't monkey with the rest of the Kosmos line.  Weird.  But the biggest issue, esp. now that I have Seafarers and 5/6 expansion, is just figuring out the setup and takedown. Extremely annoying to have different sets of chits, etc.  I've done a bit of marking-up and it works, but...poorly thought out on Mayfair's part.|13|Catan

39412|LetsGetTrivial|7.0|"Like most other people, Settlers was one of the first Euros I played and it helped start me on the hobby. I can't add anything to the praise it has received. The design is inspired and clever all at the same time.  That said, I find myself not really wanting to play much any more, especially with four players. Part of this is due to luck as some games the rolls just don't go your way. Another part is the downtime. I find myself spacing off during other players turns. Most players I know are unwilling to trade because they are worried about helping you too much. Further, I try to not plan ahead too much as things can change a lot before the dice come back to you (roads block you, solider/robber steals cards, etc.).   A biggest part, however, is the endgame. Just when it looks like someone will win, another player bashes them and further delays the game. I usually don't mind ""beat up on the leader"" as this is an important strategy for winning. For Settlers, however, it makes what should be a 30 minute game into one that is 60 hour or longer.  As such, it is the best game that I rarely have any desire to play.   Note: online play against AI helps as it speeds things up considerably. I recommend, http://games.asobrain.com  Kept for nostalgia value and as a gateway game."|13|Catan

39577|kvezner|7.0|I thought that I would love this game more, but it didn't really move me.  But objectively it is an excellent design.  My main design criticism is that I feel that whoever begins the game with the best board position has a big advantage, to the extent that he or she will probably win.  Strategy helps somewhat, but only somewhat.  You also can't gang up on the leader as effectively as in some other games.  Regardless, this game seems destined to become a classic.|13|Catan

It doesn't get played much now that I have a 200+ collection, but I pulled it out recently and it still held.  I find the dice a bit frustrating, but not so much that I would use cards, because that aspect of it is part of the appeal to the game I think.  Having played this probably 50+ times, I do find myself always going for similar types of strategies, etc. but it's still a fun game.  I really like the totally open trading aspect of this game, which is something that other games still don's seem to replicate all that well.  Other games with trading tend to have restrictions on them, whereas in settlers you can trade things like port use, robber placement, intentions on where you are building, etc.  (I know these aren't all strictly following the rules, but we allow pretty much anything in trades in the games I play)."|13|Catan

39705|Staban Tuek|7.0|The classic Euro Gateway game.  If you are one of the 5 people on the planet who hasn't played this game you really should.  It has all the features I really like in a game: a modular board, meaningful player interaction, resource management, a decent play time (about 1 hour) and moderately challenging tactical choices.  The down side is that luck can figure somewhat prominently in the game and players can make very foolish trading decisions with other players that ends up hurting you; however, that just means you have to do some table talking and stronger negotiating.  This adds in some interesting player interaction that often gets overlooked by people who don't like this game.  It's not a perfect game of course, but I think it is a good classic game that is still the gateway of choice for many.|13|Catan

One of the most reliably varying simpler games around due to the dynamic board setup, such that it's always a good battle with 4+ people as each game will be so different.  The one thing that stands out is that periods of dice droughts in the mid-game can make the game feel a real drag sometimes, as it's like watching your teeth get slowly pulled, seeing the game slowly slipping away, and with nothing you can do... all while taking depressing two second turns (with your one or two resource cards) while everyone else takes long turns doing many things.  But that aside, it's certainly a fun game.  And definitely enjoy the Cities and Knights expansion as well to spice things up.|13|Catan

39780|shaveandahaircut|7.0|[57 plays] The first German game I introduced to our family and friends. Stumbled onto it somehow in 1999 years before I discovered BGG. We played this nearly to death over the course of a year or two. In recent years it has come out one or two times each year for some fun and nostalgic play. This game deserves so much credit for the popular revival of intelligent boardgames in America. I would say more but it isn't necessary as there is just such a wealth of information out there on what a great game Settlers is both for casual play and introducing non-gamers to the world beyond Monopoly.  Enjoy the social play (although it can be mildly contentious), respect the game for how much it does for newcomers, and relax - knowing the whims of the dice can sometimes take control of much of your destiny.  Most recent play 12-31-09 -- a 4 player game with Barb, Tony, and Shelly.|13|Catan

The downsides are that you're at the mercy of the dice rolls and initial positioning is crucially important. In fact, the most interesting decisions are made during the setup, before the game even begins. But I do like the trading system, and the game can be fun from time to time as a lighter alternative. |13|Catan

It is an old game, but it still shines in my opinion.    Most certainly one of the better games ever made.  It is  a great gateway game and the game responsible for me being a big board gamer today.  The original is fine, but much better with Cities & Knights.  Always played with Cities & Knights and sometimes with the Great River and/or the Fisherman.  Rarely played with Seafarers and never with the event cards.  Got in 2004  2007 Plays = 4 2008 Plays = 1 2009 Plays = 2 2010 Plays = 2 2012 Plays = 3|13|Catan

With simple rules that can be taught in 10 minutes, continous engagement between turns and the thrill of negotiation, Settlers has always delivered a superlative first impression to new gamers. This game is a trusted friend. Highly recommended.|13|Catan

Everyone else I play with seems to love it, so I'm hoping I can wean them off.  I'm not buying all these other games so that they can just sit on my shelf, you know.  EDIT: Oh, who am I kidding.

It took a bit longer than I would have liked. I liked the event cards as they added some variety, but at the same time felt that they could seem lopsided at times.|13|Catan

40312|Turbo Pascal|7.0|Got me re-interested into board gaming around 1999 as my first foray into the world of Euro-games. Better yet, it got my spouse into board gaming and was easy to introduce to family members and friends, even if they didn't want to play nearly as often as I'd like. Loved the modular board adding replay value, the non-traditional use of dice in a game, indirect confrontation through competition for spaces, and interactivity brought about through trading - all in a game that runs 45-90 minutes.  Some minor flaws: bad initial placements can lock a player out early, serious opportunities for kingmaking if losing players freely trade with leaders close to finishing, while unbalanced starting boards that make resources unusually scarce or group dynamics that don't favor trading can result in games that drag longer than they should. Played 20+ more times than logged on BGG.|13|Catan

40392|RaffertyA|7.0|Wonderful game with several possible strategies that plays differently every time. Always ends a little too soon. A good game for the introduction of 'full scale' Euros to new players. New players would enjoy the room of the 3-player game whereas gamers need the full 4. Better balanced than the card game due ganging up to 'get the leader'. Probably should be a 7 with repeated play. Actually prefer the older edition components to the 3D version.  Unless players are of equal experience, the newer player will likely not know who is in the lead when making trades and placing the robber.|13|Catan

40400|Cleitus the Black|7.0|As a wargamer and roleplayer who favors historical or fantasy settings, I resisted playing this game for some time. Recently, I finally broke down and played the game with all the hype.  I must admit, I enjoyed it, particularly the extorting of resources from a player to avoid targeting them with the robber (is that legal?...well, we we did it!)  The only thing I didn't like is the absolute abstraction of it all.  The game system is simple and elegant, but I personally have a hard time getting into a game that doesn't realistically (at some level) depict anything.  Even Memior 44, which is hardly realistic, at least allows to me feel like I'm involved in something concrete.  I guess I'll stick with my wargames.|13|Catan

It has lost some of its coolness over the plays, I'll start to bring more games to the table and then return to this.  Edit: As you see I have bought lots of other games.   Edit: Down to 7, played it again while teaching my friend's girlfriend how to play: It just ain't worth it without C&K.

40461|esok|7.0|I played this game (and its expansions, Seafarers and Cities & Knights) several times a week for several years. It can be very frustrating when none of your numbers are rolled.  I use a house rule to mitigate no numbers being rolled especially at the beginning of the game. When you don't get any cards on a roll, you get a penny or other marker. You can trade these markers in on your turn for a resource: you turn in the same number as your current score. These markers can never be taken away and do not count against card limits, etc. It's been a while since I've played much. My Mayfair 3rd edition is really worn out, so I've collected the various 4th edition game and expansions, with the intent that I'd start playing it occasionally again.|13|Catan

Two years later. . . finally played it again. This time with a ""food stamp"" cube given to anyone who didn't get a resource that dice roll. You can trade food stamp cubes equal to your current number of victory points for any one resource card. Also, no rolls of 7 allowed on the first two rounds. These rules helped a lot!"|13|Catan

We played the living hell out of this thing and its expansions, but now we never touch it because, well, we've played the living hell out of it.  I've viewed with grudging interest some of the mini-expansions that have been appearing, and hope that/wonder whether those event cards would help ""flatten the curve"" for the production rolls.  Given the number of actual rolls made in the game, it seems like either 6 or 8 is always missed the whole time!  That's wacky."|13|Catan

40506|Red Dragon|7.0|"I like the element of chance and the great player interaction, combined with the considerable strategic and tactical choices to make.  Plays fast, no player elimination and no 'analysis' problems.  Overall, a great game that's usually a lot of fun. Not rated as highly as I used to rate it, because I see now it suffers from chance having far too much effect in the first few turns: if you don't get resources early while your opponents do, you're hosed for the rest of the game, and it's not much fun. I've dropped my rating of this game once again, after another un-fun game. I don't need to WIN to have fun, but when I've managed to build only one section of road while other players have built their third settlement and two cities, it's something wrong with the game. But don't forget, I said ""It's usually a lot of fun"" and I mean it."|13|Catan

Ticket to Ride can be a fairly quiet affair. So while TTR and other games might be more modern designs, the table talk from settlers makes it the better gateway game for me.|13|Catan

I can't help but feel that the first half of the game is mostly just sitting around waiting for good dice rolls to occur.

I must try Catan with a dice deck (easily made from two decks of ordinary playing cards) to see if it plays better. Many people call Catan a good ""gateway"" game I think Hollywood Blockbuster or Carcassonne are much more accessible to the uninitiated. It might work better with those who are already on the verge of becoming geeks."|13|Catan

40891|dzevin|7.0|1st Euro - or at least Gateway Game to bringing Euro's to US en masse.  Although I am painfully bored of this game having played updwards of 500 games, I can find no room in my heart to give this classic any less than a perfect 10.  I think, for me at least, this was the game that helped bring games from overseas to America and continues to help bring about the mainstream board game revolution that we all hope and pray continues to grow.   Update: Victorious!  That's right, my countless hours of Catan-ing finally paid dividends...literally.  I took down the Settlers of Catan Mega-Tourney at the Strategicon last week and got 100 bucks to spend on more games.  Yay sheep!!  Update 2: Victorious again! Won the US Settlers Championship at GenCon and got an all expenses paid trip from Mayfair to Germany to represent the good ol' US of A.  I was the highest English speaking finisher coming in at 8th in the world out of 56 competitors from 28 countries.   Awesome experience.  Wouldn't trade it for anything.    |13|Catan

It is great for playing with people who normally aren't into games. However, it does suffer from the problem that you can go for long stretches without being able to do anything because you get bad dice rolls for resources.

40909|puzzleme|7.0|-  This is a game that will still be played 100 years from now. A ground breaking game with all the attributes for becoming a classic. A great game for the whole family. Unfortunately, luck plays a huge role and the initial placement of the settlements can often unfairly help or severely hinder a player.  The 5-6 player game is even worse in this respect. Furthermore, the game is susceptible to decisions based on meta gaming. For these reasons it has lost its initial appeal and I play it only occasionally now. Nevertheless, its mass appeal and staying power are  unmistakable. [05/28/05: rating reduced from 9 to 8.] [03/29/06: rating reduced from 8 to 7.]  - |13|Catan

40948|guttedgeek|7.0|Showing its age compared to many other games in my collection.  It is however the game that started it all so it rightly deserves a spot on the game shelf.  Many non gamers have heard of it too so its there to tempt them into turning into a gaming geek like me! ;)  4th edition production values are average.  Poor die punching, warped hexes and unsealed/untextured cards let an otherwise pretty game down.|13|Catan

40950|rylmets12|7.0|The old standby.  This game, like for so many others, was my entrance into the wonderful world of board games.  If you play it too much, it can get repetitive.  However, a short rest from Settlers is all you need to want to play it again.  Most importantly, Settlers is the biggest hit with my non-boardgaming friends.  It has been such a treat to have found a game with the universal appeal of mainstream games and the strategy/depth of a very good contemporary board game.|13|Catan

40952|freechinanow|7.0|"It's been 10 years since I played my first game of Catan. It is still an all-time classic for me.  I know that with it being more than 20 years old now that it definitely feels dated among all the other games that have come out.  A lot has happened since my first game of Catan.  But it still and always will have an honoured place in my heart. Once you accept the parameters and that this is a fortune-of-luck game, then it's all fine. I forever will love the aesthetic and I still enjoy the nostalgia. So there we go. My first crush I don't mind revisiting from time to time (especially with Seafarers or C&K as part of it).  Legacy comment (from 2008): What a fantastic game!  I had to buy it after playing it for the first time -- making this the second game I have ever bought new (1st was ""Khet"").  The trading really makes this game engaging across the table."|13|Catan

41090|Ravenhoe|7.0|Interesting game which I played for the first time recently as many non-casual gamers fear it like the vampire fears the cross, I am not sure why. The game and the fun you have while playing it depends on who you are playing it with, some people enjoy the fierce competition and trying to blockade each other, refuse trading etc., others may find it too vicious. The random element is a nice idea, also experienced players have a big advantage. Another flaw in my opinion is the accumulative nature of successes, the more resources you have, the more you can build and the more you build the more resources you have, which can be a pain in the ass should the starting conditions be unbalanced because that will be hard to flatten out later in the game. Still, a neat little game which could have done with some better artwork and theme instead of the plaster-on. I reckon that the expansions add a lot to it but I am not sure whether Ill ever be able to give those a go, considering the general reluctance of geeks to play it.|13|Catan

I just won my first game coming from behind, and oh, was it sweet.  I'm still not going to update my rating though.|13|Catan

41175|enzo622|7.0|"This is a wonderful game; or at least it was for a couple hundred plays. I picked this up on a whim at a comic store down the street to play with my friends before we'd go out drinking. Except we had a hard time leaving the table. Soon we were scheduling Settlers evenings and playing repeatedly till the wee hours. Ah, those competitive nights of playing Settlers when somebody always wanted ""one more game.""  It seems unfair to rate this game against today's games, but I revere it as the landmark game it is and all the enjoyment it gave me, so I'll bump it up a notch. I'd be hard pressed to sit through a play of it now, however. At least give me Elasund which has a lot more going on. For expansions, I recall Seafarers and Cities & Knights as both being worth it.  This game brought me back into the hobby and, by association, to BGG, so it will always have a place of reverence in my heart. "|13|Catan

My sister-in-law gave this to us many years ago, and it definitely elevated all of our board gaming interest to a new level.  We played like 80 games of it that first year.  Now, the original pales in comparison to the Seafarers expansion, which provides for the same gameplay with infinite board varieties.  Still, we always introduce the original first to friends, and we've introduced numerous friends to this.  A great game, especially for casual or newer gamers.|13|Catan

C & K increases options but also increases playing time for a game that already overstays its welcome in my opinion.

I appreciate what it did for the hobby, but I have other games that scratch the same itch that I enjoy more.

I've tried a couple different strategies with Catan and it seems that you can win from just about any position, unless the dice are being brutal. With even semi-decent placement you can usually trade for what you need or just buy Dev cards to improve your hand.  All in all, this is a fun game and a good gateway game. |13|Catan

Cities and Knights has spoiled me... the base version is now too bland for my tastes, but this game is still a classic.    If you would've asked me a rating 100 plays ago, it would've been a 10 all the way.  As it is now, I could care less if I ever played it again.  However, I'm keeping it in my collection so I can introduce friends to eurogaming in the future.  ----------|13|Catan

41754|Pertof|7.0| Settlers started my return into modern boardgaming in 2005. For over a year it was my favourite game. But the more I played it the more annoying the dice were. Finely in 2007 I fed with Settlers up. I remember some games I lost or won only because of luck. Wining was even worse for me. Besides, if you used to play Settlers with the same people all the time you know each reactions enough to make trading very predictable and boring. Event Cards did not help - why should I trade with anybody if I get my resources sooner or later? Now  I play Settlers very occasionaly. I tried even Teuber`s official 2-players variant which is very nice to play baut a bit static.  If you search for a family game choose rather Carcassonne - shorter, better, very portable, less luck, tactical decisions every turn, short setup, etc.|13|Catan

41842|soundave|7.0|Settlers used to be THE game I wanted to play. I found it endlessly fascinating and challenging. I loved how the board was different for every game. But somehow, time has taken the shine off this game for me. I've begun to find that there are games where, when if I'm losing, I spend the entire game losing without any hope of recovery. The dice just don't go my way, a resource is scarce because of the board layout and my settlement placement order, etc. Settlers really offers a limited way to win, and if you can't get there, you WON'T be able to get there, and it's frustrating. I've seen many games of Settlers completely stall. It's a good game, and maybe I've just had some bad games recently, but on the whole, I prefer Cities & Knights.|13|Catan

41992|alexus_kazuk|7.0|One of the first games that I started playing.  Players tries to collect resources based on the dice rolls and the houses built on the resource tiles.  With the resources, players can build houses, roads, upgrade houses or buy event cards. Players can trade resources among themselves or with the boardgame so as to acquire resources they lack.  Players can also move a bandit piece which will disallow players to collect resources from the resource tile if the dice roll number 7.  Good points: Easy to play and understand  Bad points: The key of the game resides on the initial position of the 2 houses players placed on the resource tiles.  If 1 player can get resources almost every round in the game, then the player have a high chance to win the game.  The bandit to stop the winning player from taking resources has too small effect on the winning player.|13|Catan

42144|Jayne Starlancer|7.0|Ah, Settlers... so classic, so important to this hobby. If you have not played it, then please go get a copy and do so now. You won't regret it. While I don't have much desire to play anymore (I have moved toward wargames and other stuff), this game is too solid to not have played at least a few times in your life. And when I am convinced to sit down and play a game, I always enjoy myself more than I expected.|13|Catan

42157|btyyar|7.0|評分:ForLight:8 ForHard:6.5 複雜度:4 互婊度:8  如果要擴廣紙板型桌遊給新手，我認為這是一個不錯的選擇。但對於老手來說骰子運氣因素過強，而且也有其他更好的選擇。  給新手： 1.最初的二間房子的佈置占了勝負的一半，另一半則是骰運，嘴炮能發揮的作用出奇的低。 2.怖局策略分類:  木磚建築型：擴張速度高及可封殺其他玩家的出路，標準穩定的打法。  麥石升級型：初期注重升級，後期注重抽牌的戰術，但房子提供的分數會不足，是否擁有第四個房子就成為勝負關鍵，個人最喜歡的戰術。  平均發展型：最注重玩家交際手段的怖局法，上位時很容易被封殺，個人不推薦。  交易自閉型：若地圖的狀況很差，在放第一個房子時達不到上述策略，就可以先選專攻其中一種作物，然後第二個房子直接放在相對應的海港上，作物優先度麥＞木＞羊，這種打法只要等其他玩家來求你換你手上的東西就好。|13|Catan

42183|partino|7.0|"Of course I've known about this game for years, but after finally playing it (Feb. 2009), I found it intriguing, even though prior to playing I had a hard time understanding how a game of this sort could be interesting. There is much to think about, it's more competitive (and even a bit more cutthroat) than I imagined, and it's well balanced and can be tense. I'd agree with those who say this game has earned a place on department store shelves next to stuff like ""Clue,"" ""Monopoly,"" and ""Sorry."" In that regard, I'm happy to see games like ""Heroscape"" ""Axis & Allies"" and ""Blokus"" on such shelves. Too bad other new standards like ""Scotland Yard,"" ""Carcassonne"" and ""Ticket to Ride"" aren't also there regularly. [Note: As of 2012 I'm seeing more of these new standards on shelves in stores like Target.] I bought ""Settlers of Catan"" for a friend and his 14-year-old son: he couldn't figure it out, so I took it back home with me (they live way out of town) and taught myself. Then, when my friend next visited (June 2009), I taught him and he took it back. That's one way to do it! As to whether I might buy my own copy of this, to date (April 2010) I haven't yet, and I'm guessing I won't, simply because there are many other games more interesting to me. But to repeat, this is a seminal game and definitely has its place in the pantheon of outstanding games. Since of my sons got into gaming after going to college and learned how to play ""Settlers..."" I figured my family would play it so I traded for a copy of the 4th Edition, December 2014."|13|Catan

At its core it introduced me to so many new mechanics (which I thought were an impossibility at that time): Being able to play on a unique board every time; using something different to money to carry out actions; trading between players to add a bit more direct interaction; but the one that blew me away the most was the use of the dice as you didn't use them to move on a board. Coming from a Monopoly and Risk background, this changed my point of view about boardgames and paved the way for my foray into the hobby.  --------  [b]Brass Tacks[/b]:  It's a classic, but there are objectively better gateway games available nowadays. This is a game that plays fine at 3p, but is best with 4p. I wouldn't go for the 2p expansion. The trading aspect makes or breaks games. If the group is undisposed then it can grind the game to a halt. After a few plays it might even become somewhat superfluous if you control the right trading ports. At its essence, dice just adds randomness which cannot be mitigated.  --------  [b]Breakdown[/b]: [c] Rules Complexity              low/MEDIUM Rulebook Clarity              MEDIUM/high Setup Time                    low/MEDIUM Bookkeeping                   low Look & Feel                   medium Thematic Appeal               low/MEDIUM Strategic Depth               low/MEDIUM Gameplay Engagement           medium Player Downtime               low Game Length Satisfaction      medium Play Through Frequency        LOW/medium[/c]|13|Catan

We trade current and future resources, and agreements not to steal resources. We also have a fun time convincing the person using the robber not to steal from us. If my group wasn't a high interaction group this game would definatley fall a minium of 1 points on my ratings.Most of our stradegy comes at the begining of the game as we take turns placing the terrain tiles and the numbers on those tiles individually.

42568|ReinhartTR|7.0|"[b]RO:[/b] [i]12/17/2015[/i]  What is there to say about Catan? Well, a lot actually. Of course, there is it's prestigious (and hardly arguable in my opinion) claim to bringing ""German-style"" board gaming to the world. For most of us, Catan was probably the first non-American classic you played, or at least heard of.   My group and me mispronounce the name, at first ignorantly, and now out of habit as ""Kay-ten"", of course the correct pronunciation is ""Cuh-tahn"" but we've grown so used to it, that the simple misnomer ""Kay-ten"", or occasionally, ""Settlers"", is almost always how we refer to it.  There is a lot of luck here, resource generation is dice based but player investment is constant because resources can flow into your [-]sweaty hands[/-] warehouses even when it isn't your turn, and trades are flying this way and that on a regular basis. It can drag, if luck isn't on your side or you placed your settlements poorly, but overall it is leagues beyond your normal Monopoly, Risk, or Life game in terms of interaction, interest, and ability to influence the outcome through clever play. It is always fun, even if it occasionally overstays it's welcome. Many ""better"" games have come along, but there is something about the nostalgia and brilliant design that will keep most coming back."|13|Catan

The depth of stratagy and complexity of trading maintain it as a reasonable game for experianced gamers.

42706|nicodemus055|7.0|I first played at Gen Con when I was substantially younger.  I like that you have to pay attention during other turns, and that it's not a hurry up and wait mechanic.  I like the balance of the different construction options, and the different ways to score points.  However, I've always won the same way- build the longest road, use it to spread out your villages and harness needed resources ports, and once you're out of villages and have your empire in the right position, build it up to cities.  The only exceptions are when you need a city for more wood or brick to build more roads or villages.  I don't like the kingmaker aspect, and that poor strategic decisions by losing players can hand victories to other players (When 'don't give him a brick, that's all he needs to win' is ignored).  I've benefited from this before, but I don't know that deceit belongs here.     Maybe next time I play I'll gun for 'largest army' and VP cards, even though I've never seen it work.  |13|Catan

This game seems to work well both with new and experienced players, as everyone feels like they have a chance to win up until the end.  I still worry that the starting placement has too much of an impact on the rest of the game, but so far, I've not experienced any session where that's obviously been the case.  This one hit the table a lot in our group at first, especially when we're trying to push new players toward non-party games, but it has fallen out of favor lately due to a large influx of great new games.|13|Catan

Game drags and it's hard to expand and create interesting tactics. First setup becomes the main strategy. Thinking to play it more with house rule (without roads requirement).|13|Catan

42908|bfitz007|7.0|"A relatively easy to learn game that is enjoyable to play and gives everyone a chance to do well. My biggest gripe with this game is that I've found myself really ""well-diversified"" on numbers which, seems like a really good thing until I lose all the cards in my hand just before my turn. If it happened only on occasion or if I was hoarding resources it'd be easier to tolerate but sometimes it seems like it can happen every-other-turn or more and I try to use most/all of my resources on each turn.   Besides my nit-picking there, this game really does well at rewarding good strategy and is enjoyable with a group."|13|Catan

43198|placyd|7.0|Jó kis építgetős, gyűjtögetős, nyersanyag-kereskedős játék, sok interakcióval. Hátránya a szerencse nagy szerepe a kockák miatt. Hat játékból még csak egyszer sikerült nyernem. Három játékossal az ideális, mert négyen már nem nagyon férnek el a táblán.  Kicsit túl hosszúnak is találom - az elején nagyon lassan indul be, amikor még mindenkinek kevés a nyersanyaga, a vége meg túl gyors, amikor már mindenkinek rengeteg termelése van és könnyen vásárol bármit.|13|Catan

43290|potomak|7.0|This was the game that ripped me from the tendrils of Risk and Monopoly and into the world of BoardGameGeek. It gets bonus points for that. Mayfair Games has released expansion after expansion - in my mind, each one making it just a tiny bit worse than the original. I honestly don't think, in retrospect, this is a good 'gateway game'. Necessary kingmaker effect (how does a new player accurately determine who's in the lead?). It leads to a lot of player manipulation that shouldn't exist for players new to gaming. It has serious runaway leader problems if there isn't a concerted team effort to lock that player down AND a series of fortunate rolls. That being said, it's a lovely game, and there's a lot of subtlety to what is technically an incredibly simple game.|13|Catan

43366|mecheng_analyst|7.0|The variability of the board layout itself and numbered markers is what makes this a great game. You have to adjust strategies here. This also lends to high replayability. The dice add some randomness, but muffled some by the markers. The different ways to get points really adds to the fun and suspense.   Clearly this game (and series) has been successful for a reason. You can think 3 moves ahead, or just go; either way, it's still fun. The trading aspect here is done very well. Monopoly in theory has trading, but the reality there is limited.   Plays quickly once everyone knows how to play.   Edit: Rating down due to overplaying it and the C&K expansion being better. After many plays, not liking the trading aspect as much as early on. Still a great series.   |13|Catan

With all the trading, thievery, and dice-cursing it's a very social game, good for dinner parties, usually with wine and chocolate.

43510|slogosh|7.0|This may actually be a 6.5 for me, but it is difficult to distill my feelings on the actuall game play and design from the warm feelings it gives me as my first eurogame. It really is an excellent game in many ways, but two unfortunate parts plague it. For one, the luck factor screws it up for me. You roll two dice each turn, and these rolls give you your resources, which ultimately determine your success in the game. Of course, you place yourself on the map to best take advantage of the probabilities, but anyone who plays this game will tell you, dice sometimes have a mind of their own, and will often disregregard the probabilities. The other part that bothers me is how completely malicious the robber mechanic is - amazingly brutal for a gateway type game.   Having said all that, I'll also say that the Traders and Barbarians expansion neatly wipes out both of these issues for me, so get the expansion if my issues with the game seem sound to you. |13|Catan

I've decided what I like about this game the most is that most everyone knows how to play, so I do not have to explain the rules.  Nice!|13|Catan

43740|epilgrim|7.0|A game everyone should try once. Is it a classic? Probably. After the jokes are worn thin, the game endures. Regardless there are plenty of other games I love to play that owe Settlers a royalty check. Or at least a thank you card, most kids leave their folks in a lurch, so don't hold your breath.  Tueber has milked this sucker to the point of irrelevancy and each rendition sells, so I guess it is a bonafide classic. Is it plagiarism to steal from yourself, or just a sign of limited creativity?|13|Catan

43776|Hopkins|7.0|"Some gamers I know really do treat this game as a ""disposable"" gateway game but, actually, I'd be quite happy to play it again.  It is possible that I might have overrated it simply because I haven't played it for ages.  One thing I do recall is that the die rolling does make it very random.  The are simply not enough rolls of the two dice in the game to get close to the distribution of totals that you use as a basis for deciding how to place settlements, which is often quite disheartening.  Perhaps too random for a gamers' game and too complicated for a family game, but quite good fun none-the-less."|13|Catan

The one major gripe is that an initially poor position could end the game right there and then for you. Being fourth to speak on an unfavourable layout means you'll be playing catch-up all the time.

It's a nice game, but no matter how many people talk it up and say how great it is, I cannot escape the fact that every turn is decided by a roll of the dice.  I've seen people occupy every number except for the 3, 4 and 8 and watch 7-8 turns pass before being able to get a resource.  It's a little too random for me, and admittedly I burned myself out on it.  You never forget your first, but you do normally move on to greener pastures.|13|Catan

I know the lands yield based on probability, but constant robbers, getting locked out of trades, and lucky victory point draws make any kind of strategy seem meaningless. To sum it up, it's an hour long experience of what could have been decided by a coin toss.  My feelings of the game aside, this is the one game that all of my non-gamer friends constantly nag me to play. It's an awesome tool to sucker them in to the world of boardgames. And for that, I thank you Settlers of Catan.|13|Catan

Or despair when you realize that your buddy stabs you in the back by trapping you to one corner or even worse feel the hairs rising when there is nothing to do to prevent your opponent from playing the knight that gives him two more points and in a clever strike gain the trade route and on the top of that flash som victory point cards, all this takes him from last place to victory...

This really is a phenomenal gateway game, and it's still fun for gamers, but the amount of luck is a turn off for a lot of them, I think.  I was thrilled to find this at Value Village for 6.99$ punched, but unplayed and it still had the receipt in the box from the Christmas purchase.  Lucky me!|13|Catan

Worrying about which direction to build in, being cut-off, possible ports to utilize, etc. 3. Use of the Robber to keep the leader in check.   Worst features: 1.

I do find that this is a good game to break people outside of the more traditional styles of American gaming.  See Cities and Knights if you are looking for a little more depth.  See Seafarers if you are looking to play with more than 3 people.|13|Catan

44510|rakack|7.0|A true classic family game. The new edition with the nice design and figures are wonderful and has a different atmosphere than the old edition from the 1990's. Despite it is an old Spiel das Jahres game, it is still a good game but should be played only with the extensions as the base game is flat and has a big luck factor due to the dice rolls. The Event cards which replaces the dice is definitely a must for every Catan game as it makes a better planned game (not sure why it is still not shipped with the new base game). The Traders and Barbarians or the Cities & Knights extensions give more complexity and better game experience why it still remains a family game.|13|Catan

44568|Swiffle|7.0|"Fun little game.  Getting the right combination of resources for trading and building is the key.  Unfortunately, there's just enough luck with getting your numbers to come up, and not rolling 7s when your hand is large, to be problematic.  Inevitably someone gets the short end of the stick, and just can't seem to get resources, or gets his resources robbed.  Even just drawing a victory point card instead of ""another militia"" can make the difference.  It's a design decision for sure, but it's a tad more variance than I like. Nonetheless, playing it occasionally, and still enjoying this one."|13|Catan

The stack will have one 2 card (representing a die roll of two), two cards with a 3 (representing 2 dice adding up to a three.) Make sure you put the appropriate number of cards in the deck to the odds of rolling a particular number (more for 7 than 2 or 12).|13|Catan

It provides players with more information to make intelligent decisions during the game.|13|Catan

44945|SparkingConduit|7.0|Dull.  I have played too many games where one person ends up with a hand full of nothing or resources nobody wants and then proceeds to sit there miserably for the majority of the game.  Often, I have been that person.  Even though I know how to play the odds, it sometimes happens that an 8 never rolls in a game while an 11 will roll 5 times in a row.  You can't control that and half the time you can't even mitigate it.  I don't really think Settlers is necessarily a bad game, but the dice mechanic makes it so.  I have always contended that trying a new mechanic, such as card drafting or something else would make the game quite fun.  Hell, I rather enjoy Settlers of America: Trails to Rails in spite of the dice rolling because the gold coin mechanic and the sheer number of ways you can DO things with your resources really helps to avoid the rut that Settlers can induce.  EDIT: my opinion of Settlers has improved. I now consistently do well and can appreciate the game despite the age of the design. I've still played it too much to enjoy it more than a 7, though. |13|Catan

44965|Hahma|7.0|Rating based off of first game that I played and taught my 8 year-old twin daughters. They learned it pretty easily, though the game took a while because of one of the girls not keeping her hand in order, especially later when we all started getting more cards. I won with 11 points after I played a Knight to take the Biggest Army card from one of my girls (who ended up with 7 points down from 9 and could have won the next turn otherwise) and my other daughter finished with 9 points. So it was a really close game and we were all in it to the end. Trading went well and they picked up on that quickly and were good sports about it.   My one complaint so early in my experience with the game is the components, and that was reflecting in my rating. They aren't the greatest. The perimeter puzzle pieces are kind of flimsy and bend easily with humidity. Considering the game came out so long ago, perhaps they just didn't make component's as thick back then?   My rating will likely go up with more plays. I like the simplicity of it and I love that my kids really like it, so that means it will get more play and that's always part of ratings for me. |13|Catan

45125|Flashly|7.0|This is where it all started for me. After years of only playing games based upon luck (Monoply, Game of Life, Risk etc) I discovered Settlers of Catan; a game where your choices actually have an influence on the outcome of the game.  If had this game in my possession for about 12 years now, and we still play it regularly (althought most of the times with expensions).  Upsides of the game - not very difficult to explain so you can play it with almost everyone; - trading your commodities.  Why don't I rate the game with an eight? There is still to much luck involved in the Settles of Catan. And once you've played the game with one or more expansions the base-game gets a bit dull. |13|Catan

However this game is a huge hit with newcomers to Eurogames so I rated it a 7 bearing in mind that it will and always will be the go to game for new players. For me, I find it boring especially when playing against newer players as the downtime can be excrutiating for such little action (roll a dice). I think that's it. It's the downtime that bothers me the most in this game but in all honesty, I find it a little fun when there is minimal downtime.|13|Catan

45359|tuggs|7.0|Settlers of Catan is worthy of being in every gamer's library, and serves as a wonderful gateway drug.  The random setup and dice-rolling aspects of this game can infuriate players who have grown accustomed to more refined Euros, but this is one of the first crossovers that introduced many of us to grown-up board games, as we know them.  Resource management and negotiation somewhat mitigate the randomness, which is why I consider this game a notch better than Carcassonne.|13|Catan

45365|gethankins|7.0|People get down on this game now, but it's still super fun I think.  It's the game I can get non-gamers to play and they feel like they are stepping into my world a bit.  It obviously sucks to have the robber on your spot the whole game, which pretty much always happens to me, but it's a great game, and I don't mind the politicking.    I haven't played any of the other versions of this game, so I can't speak to them really - just the 4-6 player regular.|13|Catan

45401|xilconic|7.0|I was really into this game until I grew tired of it. A lot of fun for me is dependent on the group I'm playing with an their willingness to trade goods. I've played games where no-one was willing to trade among the players, and I disliked those plays severely.  Another thing I've gone to dislike about the game, is that when playing with more than 2 people, 2 people can band together to try and 'wall in' a village of the third person, very likely putting that player at such a disadvantage that he/she can no longer play a competitive role in the game and has to basically wait out the game while 'giving' away goods to the remaining players.|13|Catan

Limiting the trading to only the person who's turn it is, to me, is a must.  Otherwise, the game can take too long, and the unlimited trading ends up hurting the game, IMO.|13|Catan

Also, initial placement is *critical*, as is early expansion (and block opponents growth). So it can be clear early on that you are boned, but you still have play the game out until an opponent gets 10 VP.|13|Catan

Still, most people will have a good time here for a number of games. If you've never played it you should for historical reference.|13|Catan

45661|jdien07|7.0|"Still a classic but a bit burnt out on it.  You randomly generate a board using hex tiles, each with a terrain on it and each with a number.  Each turn you roll two dice and anyone who has a town or city built at a corner of the hex gets a resource card corresponding to the terrain.  Then you turn in the cards to build roads, towns, cities, or special action cards.  There is some fun strategy to where to build your towns and roads and outmaneuvering your opponents.  In some sense, this is a civ lite, building up your little empire.  I enjoyed working out the strategies but now that I have them down, I get frustrated by the element of luck as bad rolls can really blow the game.  Sometimes the two dice just want to reward the player who claimed the ""2"" tile for no good reason.  :P"|13|Catan

Seriously, there is no reason that the number 6 does not come up ONCE in an entire game.  However, it is one of the greatest gateway games available.  Then, it is time to move on to better games.|13|Catan

46084|mabouche|7.0|Settlers - as has been well chronicled by many other people - was a bridge game for me - that took me from the world of 'board games' as I knew them (think Monopoly, Scrabble, etc) to the world of modern/Euro type board games as I know them now (think bgg.com). At the time, I was blown away by this game and it made me catch the modern board game bug. I thought the mechanics and strategy were great.  Now, however that I've been exposed to many more (imo better) games, I'm actually not a fan of Settlers.  What I don't like about the game is that you are reliant on the trading aspect of the game for success.  Meaning if your opponents decide not to play nice and trade with you, you are sunk. I also don't love how the robber can freeze your progress of the game, and if others gang up on you your sunk. I don't typically mind the 'screw you' aspect of games, but in this case the robber combined with the trading dependencies make this game flawed for me.|13|Catan

We loved the game and in fact made a copy ourselves which got a few plays. Eventually we forgot about the game until we discovered the full depth of board games at Free Comic Book day at our FLCGS. We were excited to get a copy of Settlers as a wedding present in 2011; however, with so many other games we rarely get this to a table. It is still in the collection for when people we meet and become friends with mention ""Have you heard about this game called Settlers of Something?"".

46204|Lebotin|7.0|I can see why this is regarded as a classic. I liked it very much. The dynamics of the game are fluid and the player interactions are always fun. Playing badly in the early game leaves you so much behind though that you can't challenge other players anymore. While it's fair, it also makes the game a bit boring for the losing player. The game can sometimes drag on a lot though...|13|Catan

I would like to try it again with some variants/house rules to speed up play--e.g. the harbor master, tournament rules (second placement is a city rather than a settlement) and the welfare variant (if a player does not earn a resource from the die roll, they receive a coin; players can then redeem the number of coins equal to their victory points currently on the board for a resource of their choice).  Depending on how much they shorten the game time, these variants might even make the 5-6 player extension bearable.|13|Catan

I dont like playing this one with people who play to win.  There is a bit too much luck involved and I get tired of hearing people complain.|13|Catan

This may have been entirely true, but I applauded that the game had multiple ways to win.  The strategy employed by my friends was different than the one I used on my own.  Simple to understand and easy to set up, Catan is a great introductory board game for the uninitiated (like myself).   Now that I own a digital copy on my Playstation, I've been trying to play as much as I can to stay fresh.   |13|Catan

46479|PSantos|7.0|"This where it all restarted for me in boardgaming terms. Each game you randomly form the island of Catan by linking hexagons. Each land hexagon (barring one, the desert) can produce one of five type of resources (wool, clay, ore, wood or grain) and is given a number from 2 to 12. At the beggining of each players turn two dice and each player that has a village or a city in one of the hexagon(s) with that number get that resource. Other ways to get resources inclue trading with your opponents and, of course, robbing them. With the resources you build more roads, villages and cities, as well as buying ""development cards"" that allow special actions or offer VP. First player to get 10 VP, wins.  12 years now since discovering Settlers and I still haven't got tired from it."|13|Catan

46528|tillyhorn|7.0|One of the games that introduced our group to the wonder of games beyond the Game of Life and Monopoly this is always a fun game that incorporates resource management and negotiation skills! The chance factor comes in the rolling of two dice for resource production, other than that the most crucial factor is deciding where to start. This game can only really get unfair if in a custom game the hexes and counters favour one/two people and screw the rest over. Usually a fun game it always ends up with one person shut out and feeling dissatisifed therefore I would also like to see a variant of random/forced trading to even things out.|13|Catan

The trading and robber mechanics keep things interesting, and prevent runaway leaders, but means things can become predictable.

46645|ringo84|7.0|I think this classic is still a very good gateway Euro game, especially for families. There is quite some interaction with trading (especially if played not uber-competitively) and at the end of the game, everybody has increased his settlements. So even if you are not the winner, you can look down at the board and feel good to have build something from the ressources you produced or traded. That is probably the major appeal of Catan, which is still working nowadays. |13|Catan

46728|dejadee|7.0|Played 5+ x This is a classic game. I don't think it will ever leave my collection because it's easy to teach, there are multiple strategies, it's got that great gambling sensation when you look forward to each dice roll, and it gets people involved all the time due to having to make trades.   That being said, a lot of my board gaming friends don't like Catan because they've already played too much of it or they like heavier games or they don't like themeless games.   3-5 players is the sweet spot. 6 players just takes too long.|13|Catan

46855|Traekos77|7.0|Settlers of Catan fits the definition of gateway game quite well.  There is a good balance of luck and strategy.  The game can be easily taught in ~7 minutes and anyway, a new player can learn 90% of the game by just being the last player (i.e. watch the others play).  Negatives include the initial setup time and difficulty in recovering when behind (i.e. generally 1 or 2 players do really well while the rest aren't even close).|13|Catan

47141|univac528|7.0|This is the game that got me started in gaming.  At the time, I would have rated it a 12 out of 10 because it was so much better than anything I'd ever played before.  However, over time, I've found there are better games out there.  It's still a good one, but not one I pull out very often anymore.|13|Catan
47142|Gospel X|7.0|This being a very popular game, often referred to as a gateway game, I had high expectations for my first play. I was a little disappointed, although it is clear this is a good game. The most disappointing element is that this game is essentially Monopoly, as the rich get richer and the poor fade away. When someone isn't producing, they have no opportunity to trade and are essentially out of the game. There's little balancing there, as the only thing such players can hope for is pity. (There's no pity in this sort of game. Altruism is almost never a factor in a game unless no one is actually playing to win.) I imagine the German expansion with the helper cards (somewhat recreated in the Star Trek variant) and/or the cards that replace the dice would be a bit of an improvement, but at that point you almost have a different game. Regardless, I'll be willing to play. There's something absurdly fun about people begging for sheep.|13|Catan

47258|flyingtable83|7.0|"Good game for an active and talkative group. Some strategy mixed with a healthy dose of luck, but usually not so much that it seems based on it. The dice rolls typically pan out near averages over the course of a game due to the number of rolls.   Not a lot of depth and once you have played this game a few times it will get stale as an experience. It is a very strong ""gateway"" game, but for people who are familiar with board games and mechanics, it will not be a very strong overall experience.  This game is definitely family friendly as well, but due to the complexity of the rules and of negotiation, it's not recommended for young children (10 and up are fine, 8-10 if they are advanced intellectually).   Games don't take too long either, although they can drag if negotiations are too frequent.   Overall, a 7, with the main faults being the level of luck and the fact that you really need an active group of players to have fun, since trading is such an integral part of the game."|13|Catan

47300|SlaterX9|7.0|It is so easy to get screwed from turn one and basically have no realistic chance of winning from then on.   Also there are very few viable strategies once you are an experienced player.   This is a great intro game for people getting into Boardgaming but it doesn't hold up after you've played it a few times. |13|Catan

Initially though, we loved it, even with two players with a dummy player.  We've moved on from it though, mostly because there isn't much hope of catching up to a dominant player once they get ahead, and once that happens it can be a slow, drawn out endgame.  |13|Catan

This makes that game move at a much quicker pace and nobody is bogged down for multiple rounds without getting any resources.|13|Catan

47738|Schmeag|7.0|Settlers of Catan is a classic board game predicated on resource trading and area control and is fun for older children. I have played it with a variety of people and would say that it is suitable for 12+. It can get a little serious for an gateway board game and I have had people lose it because they have been directly hindered by another player's actions. It is not as bad as Diplomacy, however. It is a game that probably works the best on its own and doesn't really need any expansions. Best played with 3 or 4 works fine too. Further expansions such as Cities & Knights actually change the flavour of the game as opposed to adding to it.|13|Catan

As the game set a new standard at the time, I have to rate it a 7. After all, it looks nice, and with the add-ons it can be a lot of fun, but too my liking it simply takes too long, especially when you've fallen behind and need to sit it out for two hours with little chance of winning. As a result this game hasn't been played for quite a while, as there are many superior games out there. Trading away to make room for other games.|13|Catan

48110|Grumbleteaser|7.0|I've been in the gaming scene long enough to know that this title is not the end all be all of gaming.  If anyone were to tell me that this was their favorite board game, I would have to ask them if they had played any other euro games.  I can't but think that anyone who had tried several titles would have to know that the genre has evolved since Catan.  Still, Catan is not completely obsolete.  It occupies a unique position in that it is light years ahead of Parker Brothers in terms of depth, but still accessible enough to be interesting to new players who are not immersed in board gaming.  This makes it valuable as a gateway game.  I still use this to introduce friends to serious board gaming.  The gameplay itself is perhaps better than people give it credit for.  The negotiations for resources are always interesting.  The biggest problem with the game comes down to how much the dice can deny unlucky players a chance to enter the game.  Good placement and smart trading can only take you so far, but I've played numerous games in which for the first several turns only three numbers were rolled.  There are house rules and expansions that help smooth out the distribution of resources, but ultimately a pig-headed group can ruin your game.  That is not an unforgivable feature of a game.  Most games are more fun with better players, but some games just do a better job of making sure the players have to really work to hold their lead.  Ultimately, I think this a title that is well worth owning.  Even though I don't really play it with my regular game group any more, I still enjoy introducing it to new players or taking it for a spin for old time's sake.  Gaming has moved on from Settlers, which may make it seem like it's gotten worse, but it's still as strong of title as it ever was.  If you don't have it, you may not need to buy it, but if you do have it, you probably shouldn't sell it.  You'll eventually be glad you still have it.  It is worth mentioning that Catan now has approximately one million expansions and more seem to come out all the time.  Perhaps they've found a way to reproduce?  At any rate, these expansions do make the game better.  However, I think this is more worthwhile as a means of extending the life of your current copy of the game than as a reason for buying the base game.  Right now, Catan with two expansions costs around $80 ($100 for a six player board).  With three you're looking at $120 ($140 for six players).  I have had fun playing with the expansions, but I don't think the experience was worth that much, especially when Archipelago is only $60 and doesn't need expansions to be awesome.|13|Catan

48672|TwistedChopper|7.0|I'd consider myself officially graduated from Settlers of Catan. It's an amazing gateway game that just doesn't have the legs once you get introduced to other better games that are a bit more hardcore. I'd always recommend this for beginning gamers, but it doesn't last through a few play throughs. I'm glad that I have the good edition of this though because the newest version is pretty aweful. I like playing this with Cities and Knights expansion.|13|Catan
48673|gtwin|7.0|Played this to death many years before I even got into the hobby. Doesn't get to the table much nowadays though. Always happy to join in on a game however and will even suggest it for nostalgia's sake.  I like a balanced game of Settlers, but unfortunately not every game is balanced. Either I don't receive many resources and can hardly do anything, or I receive plenty of resources and end up feeling guilty towards the other players.  I'm not a huge fan of the 'will you trade your wool for my brick' mechanic. Many times people just don't want to trade with me (it feels like) or I feel like I ended up helping them more than myself.|13|Catan

48705|inexorable74|7.0|An amazing, well-balanced, fun game with tremendous replay value.  I don't understand why some game fiends get snobbish about not wanting to play SoC, like they're above the game, deriding it as a newb game.  It persists to this day as--by far--the best selling import, and was profoundly influential in the explosion of the hobby for a reason.  I recall vividly, how when I viewed the back of the box to decide if I would buy SoC, I became extremely excited about how the game board is rearranged every play, which launches the replayablity into orbit.  The gameplay is impacted by luck via rolling dice, but the game is a winner, regardless.  The player interaction is superb in the trading of resource cards.  A player that is close to winning will find themselves unable to negotiate trades and that is a great catch up mechanic.  The player who is close to winning will also get frequent visits from the robber as well.  I have fond memories of many stimulating Settlers games played and I look forward to more.|13|Catan

48778|Gmandenton|7.0|The original is still very good at what it does. This is the board game that you introduce to someone who thinks Monopoly and Clue are the sum total of what board games represent. Sit this one down in front of them, get them to try it out a few times, and then slowly introduce them to actual GAMES!  I mean, there's a renaissance out there people!  There are games on the market that create experiences you could only have if you had an actual working TARDIS: WWII battles, pursuing Jack the Ripper down a twisted branching alleyway, or defending King Arthur from a betraying errant knight. I marvel at the current artistry of the Golden Age of game design. We truly live in interesting times.  You know what? Don't play this game with people who've only ever played YHATZEE and BUNKO. Screw 'em!  If they've limited their experience of game mechanics to the intricacies of Chutes and Ladders, then this game is too good for 'em! They're in the Dark ages (which is a great expansion for Dominion, by the way). Let those people go. You can't save them. They're weighing you down. Cut the rope.  Move on.|13|Catan

Probably most people's introduction to real games, and it's still cute when a friend will tell me, ""I've played this game, you might not have heard of it... it's called Settlers of Catan"". Aww. It's done a great service by introducing more people to our hobby, but I think that the randomness (HOW CAN 2 BE ROLLED FOUR CONSECUTIVE TURNS?!) limits its ability to be higher. The lack of catch-up makes the end game fairly predictable, and the negotiations are pretty simple. But still, if someone is excited about it I'll happily play, but only as a vehicle to open them up to more exciting games."|13|Catan

48887|jammonstrald|7.0|"Catan (or Settlers of Catan as I will always remember it), is a good game. It holds up by having a very timeless quality to it. People can approach the game having never played anything like it, and they will quickly be able to understand and embrace its gameplay because it has a combination of elements that are at once familiar, but also unique in how the game presents them.   Nowadays, I find that the game doesn't fit any sort of niche that satisfies what I look for a in a game. It's too random for when I'm wanting a satisfying strategic experience; it's too casual for when I'm wanting to get engrossed in a game; and yet it usually takes too long for a game I would like to play casually.   I think Catan is the archetypal ""gateway game"", in that, I would only ever play it when using it as such (and know it would thrive being played in that capacity), but I have no real desire to ever play it of my own volition.

Due to the reliance on luck, I have really become turned off by this game. From someone that had most of his strategy based on the social game, it became to common of an occurrence for luck to run the game. I won the first 11 times I played, then would win every other for awhile until I hit a point where I would win like a normal human.   I really have just played this game too much and have lost interest in the strategy. Great game to get you into strategy gaming, just hard to play consistently once you find others.|13|Catan

49056|nickthib|7.0|My first proper board game (who would have guessed). Classic, fun to break out every once in a while, but the base game is quite dry after so many plays. Usually, winners are decided by 1) the initial placement or 2) unpredictable dice rolls. There are those few games where a particularly clever player whips out a combo of moves to rocket to 10 points unexpectedly, but usually the winner is quite clear early on. |13|Catan

49081|MasonPalmatier|7.0|Settlers of Catan was the game that launched me into the hobby of gaming.  I found the ability to be strategic so refreshing over classic games yet there was still that familiar mechanic of dice rolling that brought along with it the factor of luck.  Its variable modular board does create a new start setup every time but the feel of the game play does not vary after the initial start phase.  The start phase is so crucial to how well you will do in the game depending on your ability to follow through on your initial plans, which I believe takes a little away from Catan.  I've found myself not wanting to play this game over and over as I originally did but am eternally thankful to it for giving me a new hobby.|13|Catan

49083|star2pilot|7.0|This game is quite interesting. I'd probably pick up the seafarers expansion, but those no-goodies that publish it decided to parse out the 5-6 player expansions for each expansion, so, they get not a dime more from me unless they decide to skip the cash grab and just let me buy the once.   |13|Catan

49087|Triumph44|7.0|I realized the reason why Catan is so great is that your settlements and cities reach their ideal productive capacity right as the game is ending.  That feeling of getting 3 Ore in a turn, or 4 resources overall - it feels really good, and you want to have it again, so you play again.  I feel like it's hip to badmouth Catan and it wouldn't be my first, fifth, or even tenth choice to play were it my option, but I've played it live more than any other game; it's held up pretty well.  EDIT 11/17 - I'd like to lower my rating of Catan, but it's me that's changed and not the game - I've just played it too many times.|13|Catan

49120|IceFire1424|7.0|Often considered by many to be the gateway game into modern boardgaming, Catan shines through interaction with other players. Simple mechanics make for an easy to understand game, although more players are required to truly enjoy it. With games lasting up to 90 minutes, interest can begin to wane, especially if one player is clearly dominating.   Despite having set up the game a few times, we've yet to actually complete a full game. Although it's supposed to be a gateway game, I'm still not certain on a few of the rules, which is a bit frustrating. |13|Catan

49289|Elankat|7.0|I know this game has a reputation of being a classic gateway game and an intro to Euro games, but it's never been my favorite. I like the negotiation and player interaction, but it just doesn't hit the table much. I'll play it and enjoy myself, but it just doesn't tend to be a game I suggest. It's a favorite for my husband and youngest son though. Purchased from a FLTS.|13|Catan

There is simply not room enough on the island, and one or two players are sure to get cornered and have a really long and boring game. DON'T play with 4 players!|13|Catan

49385|ThunderRam|7.0|At first this game was, in my mind, a 10 Perfect Score. But after hundreds of games in person and on the mobile app you begin to realize that the game is basically 75-80% luck and the strategy really relies on the 1st move of the game.   After the 1st and 2nd move you basically watch as the game plays you.   Still a great game though but look for even better games. |13|Catan

49391|Cranthony|7.0|Catan does something that no other board game does for me, and that's mixing player interaction with individual turns well. Of course it might feel like there's downtime sometimes when people aren't trading, but I don't feel bored when I play like some games with individual turns do. I like Catan, but I like lots of other games better. |13|Catan
49392|driscoll42|7.0|Ah Catan, a fantastic intro to Euro board games game, which I played far, FAR too much in high school. Definitely a good game, tight rules, and a fair amount of strategy, but gets old after a while. If you need a game for friends to start to play after Risk, Monopoly, Scrabble, you can't go wrong with Catan.|13|Catan

49418|YeahWay|7.0|"Great game! Very easy to learn and pick up. Strategic nonetheless! Settlers of Catan was my gateway game.  The only reason why I don't want to give it a 10 is because it's pretty easy to tell who is going to win the game about 7 or so rounds in. You can snowball very easily in this game, however the incorporation of the crippling ""7"" roll can definitely balance things about. Plus, development cards can become VERY useful, depending on the timing.  What's nice is there is some variability from game to game. You will never have the same game twice. Replay-ability is definitely HIGH.  I would give this game a 9 if there were some way to buy resources from other players, much like in 7 Wonders. I don't want to talk too much about the mechanics, but you get the point."|13|Catan

49440|ChromiumAgeCollector|7.0|This is easily the best board game of all time, in my opinion.  It hits on all the high notes for me: easy to play, fast, interactive, replayable, etc.  It fires on all 8 cylinders, and I've only met 1 person ever who didn't like it.  Anyone who gives this game less than a 6 is a troll.  Yeah, I said it!  UPDATE:  For the longest time I refused to admit this game is not a 10.  While I do still like playing this game, and while I still strongly recommend it to people interested in gaming...  I just have little desire to bring it to the table anymore.  Initially I thought this was just due to burn out, but I have finally realized it's because it's just not compelling enough and there is a lot more competition from better games.  Sadly, I have dropped this to a 7.|13|Catan

For more-than-casual gamers not deep enough and too luck-dependent.|13|Catan

49588|TopherHernandez|7.0|Good: -Trading -Lots of player interaction -Borderline gateway game -Easy to understand and execute strategies -Cheering for die rolls  Bad: -Waiting on rolls -Balance issues (city strategies are too good) -Encourages mean-spirited play -A little long for what it is -Starting villages typically determines who will win  Overall: The player interaction that comes from trading adds a lot of interaction and seems to be the main selling point.  But trading slows the game down and gives savy players an even bigger advantage.  This was one of the best gateway games when it came out and holds a special place in my heart but I now struggle to find a reason to play it.  It's not deep enough for play with hobbyists, not a top-tier family weight game, and not ideal for introducing the hobby.  While I definitely got my moneys worth, it will be collecting dust for the foreseable future.|13|Catan

49627|kaneAAA|7.0|Catan is good for beginners, gateway game etc.   The more experienced gamers start to get put off by it for the simple reason that too much of the mechanic is put down to luck. It's just a fact that too much of the time people who should have won don't and those who aren't so hot can get very lucky. Therefore, it's kind of like a slot machine at a casino if you get a group of competent gamers playing each other, i.e. it boils down to a gambling, uncontrolled game of sorts.     Oops forgot one final point. .. It's not that fun after a while...it's just kinda there chugging away....meh|13|Catan

Having said that, the game is still fun to play, but I prefer to play similar, more modern games that are annoying less of the time."|13|Catan

I can't say anything good about it that hasn't been said before, so I'll say something bad about it instead.  The one thing I don't like about Catan is that I find it a little too easy to get an early lead from mean positioning of my initial roads, etc., which basically subtly screws over other players for the entirety of the rest of the game.|13|Catan

It works great as a family game if you're into competitive trading games (which I'm not).  If I'm going to play a game about colonialism, I'm going to play Concordia - it's a far superior game in every way.  ;)|13|Catan

Revendido por V.Karku  Los jugadores ya avezados lo encontraran quiza con ""poca chicha"", pero yo lo considero un buen juego para iniciarse en las mecanicas de los ""modernos"" juegos de mesa. facil de comprender y apto para todos los publicos.   En mi opinion destacan las fases de negociacion. esos ""oveja por ladrillo?""...""dos ovejas por ladrillo?"" son ya un clasico del mundillo.   Las expansiones le vienen bien para ""darle vidilla"" y mejorar versatilidad (el original solo admite 3 o 4 jugadores).  de hecho ese es en mi opinion el principal defecto del juego: que se creó inicialmente para 3-4 (y SOLO 3-4) jugadores, luego fue expandido y DESPUES DE ESO fue cuando salió la expansión para adaptarlo a 5-6 jugadores... mas luego las expansiones para adaptar las expansiones existentes a 5-6 jugadores. un desperre y un caos.   quisieron evitar vender un nuevo juego base con el que las expansiones antiguas no fueran compatibles y en mi opinion fue peor el remedio que la enfermedad. :/ "|13|Catan

50146|Kether1983|7.0|Igazi klasszikus. A Catan esetében a szabályok elsajátítására, tanulmányozására nem kell napokat áldozni az életünkből. De még órákat sem. Ez nem jelenti, hogy nem lehetnek vitás kérdések. :D Elég könnyen átlátható akár már első próbálkozásra. Lássuk be, rendkívül nagy a szerencse szerepe ebben a játékban is. Hiába próbálunk úgy helyezkedni, hogy a könnyebben kidobható számokat tartalmazó mezőkkel érintkezzen a településünk, városunk, ha utána mégis ritkán jönnek elő azok a számok. Szerencsére azért ez nem egy felturbózott szerencsejáték csupán. A kereskedéssel meg kell próbálni a céljaink eléréséhez nélkülözhetetlen nyersanyagok beszerzését. Ez jó kis interakciót biztosít a játékostársak között. A győzelemhez szükséges 10 pontot meg egyáltalán nem olyan könnyű elérni. Az tetszik a Catanban, hogy ha egy család úgy dönt, hogy csak az alapjátékot veszi meg, akkor is rengetegszer újra játszható a társas, mert a területlapkák elhelyezése szabadon variálható, meg persze az azokon szereplő számok is. Ez is olyan játék, ahol több úton is el lehet jutni a győzelemhez. Van, aki csak a települések, városok építésére áll rá, van aki a fejlesztési kártyákat gyűjti, van, aki mindenféleképpen birtokolni szeretné a leghosszabb út címét, stb. Ráadásul nagyon hangulatosak az illusztrációk. Nekünk már a műanyag figurás változat van meg, de nem érzem gagyinak ezt sem. Biztosan más érzés fabábukkal játszani, de nekem ezzel sincs gondom, itt legalább részletesebb egy-egy elem kidolgozása. Azért 4 fővel ez sem a legrövidebb játék, mind a két menet kb. másfél óra volt. Egyébként az, hogy minden egyes dobásnál figyelsz, hogy kapsz-e nyersanyagot, minimálisra csökkenti az üresjáratot két köröd között. Persze előfordulnak olyan szerencsétlen szériák, hogy akár két teljes kör is végig megy, te meg csak ülsz és szomorúan nézed az egy szál erőforrásodat a kezedben, ami sehogyan sem képes az osztódással szaporodásra.|13|Catan

50339|dlc_1532|7.0|[December 2014 - 7] The gateway game. Like many, it was one of the first few games I played to get into the hobby. I enjoy it, but the trading and the dice-rolling luck ultimately play too big of a role in the game. Especially with the dice, if your numbers aren't coming up, it means your opponents' numbers likely are, so its sort of double whammy and the gap between the leaders and losers widens (I have the same complaint about Machi Koro). You'd think the trading might balance that, but if you have nothing to trade, because your numbers aren't coming up, then you're out of luck there, too. Meanwhile the leaders can trade and widen the gap. All that wouldn't be so bad if it were a shorter game, but it's a little lengthy.|13|Catan

50429|kpackman|7.0|This was the game that got me into board gaming almost three years ago. It doesn't come off of the shelf often simply because of the play time. The number of hours it takes varies heavily by who you play it with (if drinking is involved, you're gonna be there for a while...) and if you dare to go all the way up to the 6-player count. Regardless, it's still a fun game, but at least for me I think it's fine as is and I probably won't expand.|13|Catan

50520|neinbit|7.0|A good game. However, the starting phase is a huge drag and often the table will go silent as everyone goes through the boring moves of slowly collecting resources. It takes forever to get the ball rolling. By the time the game has some momentum, people are sometimes already exhausted from the tedious ramp-up phase. Once you're there, however, the game is fun, challenging and exciting.|13|Catan

50542|gorillaz2323|7.0|The game that opened my eyes to the fact that board games can be something truly special. I love the way the board looks, its a lush island with resources everywhere, in fact, I've used the board as a map for roleplaying, it works quite well. Anyway, my only quibbles are that the game can be quite boring if your die rolls never come up. I've played games where I maybe got my number 2 or 3 times. Fortunately, the game doesn't last very long....except for that one three hour 6 player game. That was brutal.   2019 update, I am dropping the score because the game doesn't hold up as well after playing so many other games. |13|Catan

50556|Oneliness|7.0|[WrenniePennie's copy] The title that got me back into board gaming, and is very much like comfort food for me. Some of the mechanics that encourage resource hoarding seem antiquated and unbalanced nowadays, and the dice rolling, in hindsight, causes strategic placement and luck to crash rather than flow together, making resource-generating a frustrating affair for some members of the game. However, the random generation of land masses, building, and competitive factor in trading still make this one fun to play. |13|Catan

I've only played the Star Trek version in real life (which I didn't really dig) but played the app on my phone a LOT when I was first getting into board games.  I can see why it is so popular but I feel that in recent years there are many games that offer more in theme and gameplay.  One I wouldn't mind owning just because it seems I should, but not one I really think, I would like to play a game of Catan right now.|13|Catan

50714|mdahl14|7.0|The board game I've played most - over 50 online games, and over 25 in person, with 7 in one day once. I don't think it is as great with the expansion for 6, and I dislike the seafarers expansion.   I've played this successfully as a teams game with the following rules:  - sit across from each other - cannot trade more than 1 resource on your turn to your teammate  - each player needs to score 10 - can share 1 point from longest road or largest army with teammate for victory points It reduces the trading aspect of the game, but adds a fun layer of backstabbery strategy.|13|Catan

50791|white_lys|7.0|This game basically got me into modern board gaming.  Once I started playing, I couldn't stop.  It's simple and addictive.  However, after having gotten into board games and having played many others, Catan doesn't quite hold up.  First off, there's too much luck involved.  This can overcome with good building placement, but there are some games where 6 or 8 (the numbers that should come up more often when rolling 2 die) just never come up but 3s or 10s come up over and over again, rewarding the lucky player who just happened to chose those resource hexes with an easy victory.  Bottom line is: if your numbers aren't rolled, you lose.  And the game gets very frustrating and/or boring when you're hopelessly losing since the better you're doing, the easier it is to do even better.  I recommend new gamers give this a try.  It's fun and will get you into gaming.  Then, to add some complexity and replay value, get some of the expansions.  The Cities & Knights expansion makes the game great by adding the needed complexity.  Explorers & Pirates is also really fun, though it basically makes it into a different game. I've never been a big fan of Seafarers, it doesn't really add a whole lot in my opinion like the other expansions do.  Traders & Barbarians, in my opinion, is the best at fixing the original game without changing too much.  Some of the additions (especially fish and the cards instead of dice additions) really make the game less about luck and more about strategy.    Catan is not my favorite game, but I keep comping back to it.  It holds a special place in my heart I guess.  It's worth playing for sure.|13|Catan

50971|mdaffonso|7.0|A classic. Aged pretty well. Some will say it's just random dice rolling, and that might seem true on your first couple of plays, but there's much more to Catan than that. It's all about positioning, trading and managing your hand to avoid the thief.|13|Catan

50980|Not Bored Games|7.0|This was my gateway game. I first played when my cousin brought it to a family reunion in 2000. I have never been the same since.  I still have it in part due to nostalgia.  Good for a beginner game, but I feel that there are better introduction games for new players.   I think my biggest knock on the game is that it is normally just my wife and myself playing games, which makes it difficult to play Catan. Then when we do have a large group, it just takes too long to play a 6 player game of Catan.|13|Catan

I actually don't have my copy of this anymore due to lending it to someone and never getting it back, but man did I play the crap out of this in High School. At the time, it offered so much that no other board game I had ever played did. It's still a good light-medium Euro in my opinion, and I would honestly be glad to play it if someone offered. That being said, since I am usually the one with and introducing the games, this gateway game will take a backseat when it comes to games like Pandemic or Ticket to Ride.|13|Catan

51268|Jstjred|7.0|It's a classic.  I have friends who want to be introduced to new games, and then they only end up playing this anyway.  It's just solid, and they haven't played enough to be interested in branching out to other things for fear of it losing the appeal.  It's a good resource trading game, but I have to force myself to trade with others.  I always try to be self sufficient and if I'm not careful I can ruin other's experiences.|13|Catan

51397|westph21|7.0|This was my first hobby game, and it really drew me into board gaming. I have not played the game in a while, but I still enjoy the game. It is quick to learn, quick to play, and keeps all of the players involved. If there is any downside it is that the theme is a little dull. In the game you collect and trade resources with other players in order to build new cities. Resources are produced through dice Roll and traded on each players turn. 3/1/16|13|Catan

51583|dannaeil|7.0|A classic game now, easy to learn and play. Has the potential however to make some players just 'passengers' in the game, with virtually no chance to win even in early stages if cornered or boxed in and unable to expand. Best played with some of the expansion scenarios, like the 'Helpers' or 'Frenemies' which speed up gameplay.|13|Catan
51584|ajmcblain|7.0|The more I play other games the less I like Catan. This game is not fun when you are crushing everyone and not even playable when you're doing bad.

51618|dervich|7.0|Catan was truly my gateway game at the early years of the XXI century (i never get to knew Carcassone at the time and, anyway, it won´t qualify) so, it sets another standard point at my rating list. Englobing just a few more mechanics and set up work than a vintage, Catan has already most of the features of a modern eurogame, though at small level.  Easy to grasp, with fast playing turns in a suitable short overall playing time and keeping pure chance at low level, it was perhaps the first non abstract game that could provide the feeling of really taking your destiny into your hands while building something. Nice to go along with family, friends or even maybe light gamers (who knows), Catan still remains a quality product and enjoyable, if one is by now not tired of playing it again and again.  Edit: In spite of all what is written above, after almost 4 years of new games experiments, it is quiet unfair to other modern games to rate Catan so high (7.5), so i am forced to drop it a bit, in order to keep things balanced. |13|Catan

51768|Thip|7.0|This baby got me into board gaming. I played around 500 games of this before I realised that maybe I should see if there are other similar games out there :)  I strongly recommend the Cities and Knights expansion. Once you've figured out the few basic strategies of this it basically comes down to the dice - Cities and Knights opens up multiple paths to victory, and the game actually becomes quite strategic. Of course it is always gonna come down to die roll still, but I think it's a vast improvement if you don't mind more complexity.   The rating is a bit down partially cause I just don't play it anymore since I've almost seen every possible because the newer games today, having improved upon this, scenario played out multiple times, also partially are just so amazing and well made that I have to rate this lower than those. |13|Catan

51790|straubi|7.0|"This game is the epitome of streamlining and elegance.  The rules are so simple and so clearly comprised on a few cards, yet you can do vastly different things, you win on only 10 victory points, get some ""haha"" moments against your opponents that feel like your master strategy being executed but still maintain a non-gamer friendly level of luck and have no real downtime on your opponents turns as you also get resources and look what they do.  Compared to e.g. Stone Age, this truly is a non-gamers game.  So, why no perfect 10 rating?  After years I just grew a bit out of the simple base mechanics, the luck factor is too large for my taste and the game does not bring forth that much exitement for me anymore. Still gladly playing it though."|13|Catan

51927|arianapequena|7.0|My original gateway board game, really where I first got into the hobby. I still think it's one of the standard and best euros out there, and deserves its place in history for being a game which appeals to a multitude of people despite being a euro and a more heavier game than most amerithrash.  The part I dislike most about the game is the reliance of rolls to snowball into the later game. If you don't get great rolls early, it's very easy to quickly be pigeonholed into a boring, helpless position and vice versa. There is very rarely any playing from behind and the ending of the game is very anticlimactic.   Overall, I still really enjoy the game and would be happy if pulled out just for familiarity but I would almost always want to pull out other games. Great gateway game.|13|Catan

In fact, we had such a good time, I decided to buy the game even though we didn't really have enough players to play.  I saw that there was a Catan Junior and really had thought about getting it for our family.  After thinking about it a while, we opted against it and sat down with the family to play this one.  We found that the 10yr and 7yr was easily able to grasp the general concept of the game and my 5yr was on my team.  The boys quickly caught on and I swear my daughter was a shepherd in a past life time.  We always seem to stock pile sheep.|13|Catan

52203|Debonair Deviant|7.0|Review - I know Catan can get some hate from the more hardcore side of the strategy gaming community, but I love it for one simple reason: it’s easily one of the best bridge games. If you’re trying to drag friends from Monopoly into the world of strategy gaming you’d be hard pressed to find a better option. It does have shortcomings such as the randomness of dice rolls and map construction, a tendency for games to run long, and a lack of options/strategies (not including expansions), but some of that can be remedied with house rules. Honestly though I think that all plays into its charm. It’s certainly not a game for every occasion, but when you’re looking for something a little lighter, or trying to teach strategy gaming basics it’s near the top.|13|Catan

52254|liyamu|7.0|Was the gateway game that got me into modern gaming.  Nowadays, I'd rather play something else, but I have acknowledge its success.    However, the two main turnoffs for me are: The randomness can feel punishing, when a good strategy falls flat on its face because no 6s or 8s have been rolled, despite probability, and in my experience, in a 4 player game, 1 player usually spends the game stagnant, unable to really achieve much.    The second, is that I don't like how critical the starting positioning is.  With experience players, I feel like I can accurately predict who will win 80% of the time based solely on where everyone starts. |13|Catan

There were other games that really sealed the deal, but it all started with this one. I hadn't played boardgames for years until this game along. So mad props to it for getting me into the hobby.  That said, it's a good game, but no longer my favorite. We still bust it out every now and then with friends.|13|Catan

I have play the game enough to not need to play it again but I am willing if I am in the right mood and with the right people.  Stored in bitbox medium.

However, now if I play I much prefer it with the C&K expansion in order to give it a bit more depth. Seafarers isn't as balanced as I would like, so that version sees the least play from me. Catan is still a great starter game that can sway non-gamers, and has a good balance of luck/strategy/interaction to keep things interesting.|13|Catan

52617|mattbain31|7.0|An OK mainstream game that most people have played by now. But as such, i'm all played out on this game. It relies too heavily on player negotiations for goods. And you can already pretty much tell who's going to win, based on where the starting settlements are placed. This game did wonders for the boardgaming community, but it has overstayed its welcome in my collection. Get those player negotiations out of my strategy game, and outta my face! Time to grow up and play Castles of Burgundy. |13|Catan

I don't get it to the table much anymore just because it's a bit intense for new players and I've got other gateway games to teach people.  My preference is to only play this with four players who don't mind yelling at each other across the table.  I normally recommend a good coop after we play this to calm everyone back down.

It is special because it blends strategy and luck fairly well, and being able to trade resources between other players makes for interesting interactions each time.  I would give a higher rating, but I'm trying to balance nostalgia with reason.

52641|karmakanik|7.0|Like many, this was my introduction to modern board games.  I was immediately captivated by this fascinating creation.  It's strategic, but it has random dice rolling!  It's competitive but there's no player elimination!  You'll likely get stomped your first game, but once you have the basics down, most games come down to a close finish.    My wife and I soon bought our own copy and played and played, and introduced it to new people.  After a while, and a lot of plays, the game started to irk me more and more.  I disliked getting screwed over by a string of streaky dice rolls.  I disliked everyone ganging up on one player with the robber.  I disliked that the five resources were not evenly balanced.  I disliked other players making suboptimal trades with each other.  I started to discover other, newer (clearly better! lol) games, and began to turn up my nose at lowly Catan.  I've since come back around.  There are other better gateway games that have come along (e.g. Ticket to Ride, Splendor, Dominion).  There are other games I'd rather play on most any given game night.  But I enjoy it for what it is:  a solid light-middleweight euro that's fun to dust off every once in a while.  It's not the be all end all of strategy games.  But even in spite of its unprecedented success, it has a unique mix of mechanics, strategy and interaction that has never been duplicated.  approximate number of plays (pre-2017):  50+|13|Catan

53288|oninoyakamo|7.0|22 years. It took 22 years for me to finally get a chance to play this game. Despite its age, The Settlers Of Catan still holds up. Yeah, I could see having too many of the same resource being clumped together during setup cause balance issues, but that is a minor quibble. Trading, points for victory, a minor screw-your-opponent ability, and an innovative dice roll payout mechanics; its no wonder that tSoC took the world by storm and ushered in an era of interest in Euro board gaming.  There are so many versions of tSoC and expansions for the game, but were I ever to buy it, I would probably stick to the vanilla version as 3-4 players is probably the best for game length and a theme change doesn't interest me.  Oh, and despite the official shortening of the game to just 'Catan', I will probably always refer to it by its full title as it evokes memories of the reverence people held for The Settlers Of Catan in the late 90's.|13|Catan

I always referred to this as Settlers.  *shrug*  As for a comment, I have nothing of value to add to the bajillions of words contributed here.  It's great, timeless, and always entertaining.  You can definitely have ""too much"" of it, but that doesn't last long, imo.  Big points for being something my parents love to play."|13|Catan

53339|turtler7|7.0|I loved playing this game with all engineers.  I find with other, more diverse, gaming groups either i get targeted into oblivion with the robber shutting down income, taking my resources, AND everyone refusing to make trades even they want to initiate on their own terms because they want the trade with anyone but me since I might benefit fromt that.... OR I get ignored even a reasonable amount and win without feeling like I was ever in danger of not winning.  There isn't a lot of intermediate experiences between those two extremes anymore so I have dropped its rating just down to a 7.  This was my gateway into the hobby.|13|Catan

53576|CopperBlint|7.0|Like many others, this is where it all began for me. I loved it as the base game, then we got the Seafarers expansion which we never played with until we got Cities and Knights as well. Those two expansions in addition to the 5-6 player extension allowed for massive sprawling boards of epic proportions where we implemented exploration and sailed into the ocean to discover land. The games typically lasted upwards of three hours or so, but I would no longer play it any other way. It is too bland without a bunch of unique rules.|13|Catan

53583|Ranior|7.0|Classic, and still is pretty good. The game has a lovely arc of development and building things up while offering fun trading opportunities. I don't love the lucky/variable nature of it, even though it's not as big a factor in determining a winner as many would seem to think it is. (What I'm saying is that Catan still is largely won by being a better player and playing the odds well).   It plays fast and is very accessible. I have fun playing this here and there even though I've grown to enjoy resource management/development games like Terra Mystica much more.   Update Apr 2019: I've played this a bit more in the past few months and upping this to a 7. It's a very good game and it does so many things better than many newer designs. It actually has some really solid player interaction, it has a good amount of depth and skill despite those who would proclaim it be about luck, and a nice little arc of engine building development. |13|Catan

53599|Hafergulden|7.0|Siedler! An excellent game that I dislike. Now, it’s quite easy to coax me into playing, and play will be fun and intense, but to be good at this game you cannot rely on luck and placement alone; you need to enjoy and be good at trading, negotiating, and manipulating your co-players in order to overcome shortages, bad die rolls, and poor odds. Good at this I am not; neither do I enjoy it. Still, a great game.|13|Catan

53618|Madl3r|7.0|Fun classic game. A little tough to explain at first, but easy to play once you get it. When playing well this can be a great game with lots of planning and player to player trading and bargaining. At its worst players can be essentially kicked out of the game if they get unlucky or are put into a bad position.|13|Catan

54180|Kromlek|7.0|Several paths to victory (focus on developments, towns, or spreading out). Best part is open trading, which helps players deal with the luck of the dice and allows for certain players to monopolize a resource and trade for what they need. 4 players can be quite cramped on a normal map and newer players can feel trapped with few options.  At this point I've played it so much I'm done (base game). |13|Catan

54198|jrgainey|7.0|I like Catan, and it is certainly a classic. I love it's universal appeal. My rating would probably be higher, but it sometimes drags on too long (especially with 5 or 6 players - NEVER doing 6 again), and some games are going to be miserable if the dice rolls keep you from getting necessary resources.   I'd usually rather play Ticket To Ride - similar game, shorter game length, less susceptible to bad luck (most of the time). |13|Catan

Yeah, there is a lot of luck, but it is not like you are playing for hours to get crushed by it.  It plays fast enough to never feel burdened by playing it.  I like Catan.  Stop hatin'  ; )|13|Catan

This does however reduce replayability. Can be frustrating at times when you can not do anything as you do not have any resources, and the dice do not co-operate.|13|Catan

54829|Chaz1029|7.0|I use this game as an introduction to board gaming as it is such an easy game to pick up. The game works best with 3 players as 4 can be a bit crowded, but it also works with 2 players. To do this you create 2 separate islands with the same resources and same odds but with different merchants. When a 7 is rolled, instead of using the robbers, switch merchants. This works really well as the merchants allow for a HUGE advantage.   A fun game to play for a few rounds, however after that game play can get a bit repetitive.   Fun game with an unexpected amount of strategy.|13|Catan

54899|Jag_girl|7.0|A friend bought me this one Christmas knowing I'd started buying a few boardgames. I can see why this started the ball rolling for the modern era. It's a nice looking game, has fairly simple rules, has variability/re-playability and the trading with other players offers great interaction, with often some very funny banter! I just wish the expansions weren't so expensive as I'd love to buy seafarers or explorers but not at the prices they sell for!|13|Catan

55032|dmartin1982|7.0|2017-11-10 Catan is finally starting to fade for me, which is why I am going to downgrade it from an '8' to a '7'.  I no longer actively seek to play it, but can enjoy it when we do.  However, I've found that other games—most notably 7 Wonders—improve on Catan's civilization-building theme by having better mechanics.  E.g., severely mitigating the luck mechanic; reducing the punitive interaction between players, etc. -- 2017-03-20 Catan has never gotten old for me. It's a great gateway game, and also a classic to play with the family on Sunday afternoons.|13|Catan

55058|tburklin|7.0|I kinda think it was the world’s greatest gateway game. I have the same cliches about blowing Monopoly and Risk out of my personal waters. I still think that for non-gamers this can still be the ‘I didn’t know it could be like this’ moment that brings them to our side. But, after about 50 plays, including (especially) the app, it can be super frustrating that it relies on dice, the more normally distributed 2d6 notwithstanding. So now, I won’t play it unless some wide eyed newbie just heard about it and wants to play. After all those plays, I think that’s about all you should expect from a game - this one goes in the hall of fame.|13|Catan

55221|atmpoison|7.0|It can become a fun game, which depends largely on chance.   The problem is, the difficulty to get resources and move forward, if the other players do not want to exchange resources with you, then it can become a long and boring game, you can stay stagnant. As the author said, it is a game that tries to reflect that we must share in order to advance, although later, only one will be the winner.|13|Catan

That being said, it is more reliant on luck than a lot of the other games I play, and as a result, it will not be at the top of my list.  My strategy is to go broad on dice results so that there is rarely a roll that doesn't benefit, but sometimes, that is not a winning combination.  It seems that there is always one number that comes up more than its distribution warrants, and no way to strategize for that."|13|Catan

55705|Rorwig123|7.0|To be honest, I don't get why people are so against games that use dice. This game was the first modern board game I have played, which this game is a gateway game for most people, but it also has depth and strategy. People can have their opinions about games that focus on dice, but if that is your opinion, then opt to not play the game instead of forcing your opinion on others. Overall good game, but there are definitely others that I would prefer to play, especially after the hundreds of times that I have played this game.|13|Catan

I enjoy the trading and negotiating aspects and secret victories, because who knows how many victory points people are hiding in their development card pile! Definitely a keeper.   Update October 2018: I have slightly cooled on this game due to how swingy it can be based on dice rolls.|13|Catan

55961|stoebner|7.0|After Monopoly and Risk, Catan is possibly the most well known board game. The gateway game for many of today's boardgamers, Catan is iconic. And while Catan is an excellent gateway game, it's just that, a gateway game. Most board game players will eventually grow tired of Catan and move on to more complex and newer games. But Catan retains a spot on their game shelf, fondly reminding the owner of past games with friends. We feel indebted somehow to the game, a first love with a special place in our hearts. And when it's time to introduce someone new to board games beyond Monopoly and Risk, Catan waits on the shelf - smooth, simple, easy to teach - ready to welcome a new gamer to the hobby.|13|Catan

56245|VampireHunterD|7.0|One of the 'founding fathers' of modern board games.  Cata is straight forward, has a high level of interaction, and is compact.  That being said, starting position and early rolls have a HUGE impact on your chances to succeed.  This game is largely focused on dice rolls - so luck/randomness is a major element in Catan.  Catan isn't a fair game, but it's still quite a bit of fun due to resource trading interaction between players.|13|Catan

56585|Nenananas|7.0|[b]Like:[/b] -Simplicity for what it achieves -Trading -Building stuff and receiving more stuff for it -Many people know this game  [b]Dislike:[/b] -Robber -Having multiple turns without anything to do because your numbers didn't get rolled  The game I played the most before I really got into board gaming. I mean, what other game lets you build towns and cities, and gain increasingly more resources when you do so while also allowing you to negotiate with others; am i r8?! No wonder I considered this a masterpiece at the time.  If Dead of Winter has the meanest dice of all time, Catan probably has the meanest gaming piece of all time: the Robber. This little sh*t used to make the people I played with literally cry. Luckily, we all kinda realised this and only put it in someones place if that guy was far ahead.  Also, going through multiple rounds without getting anything just sucks, especially if all the others get huge amounts.  Catan: Cities & Knights is absolutely required for me to enjoy this game though.  While I'd rather play other games now, it still's got the advantage of being the simplest build, receive more and trade game I know of. Be careful not scare the new-lings away from the hobby with the robber though!  |13|Catan

56610|Tophknight|7.0|"Not a bad little game. Placement and die rolls can kill you, but as long as the map is not overcrowded usually you can give it a good go. Negotiation is not a ""bad"" feature as long as everyone knows the game and knows how to wisely negotiate. Playing with someone who gives another player whatever they want or because they are charismatic will kill it though."|13|Catan

It's rather enjoyable game, you do really need to strategize pretty well. A downside is that it can be pretty brutal, especially if you don't have a good numbers and this can really suck. As well, with more players, it can take quite long to wait for your turn.|13|Catan

After my first play, I was excited to play more. After the next few plays, I was ready to get back to playing the many eurogames I like more than Catan. I think maybe the age of Catan has passed. It's a shame I couldn't play it when it was a more revelatory experience, but at least it's still a nice time.|13|Catan

I found this old version of Catan in used section of game store in unused condition, the previous owner just unsealed it but not even put tiles out of the package.  I decide to use this game to encourage my colleagues to play game and it is worked!!! Since then, we usually have gaming night 2-6 times a month.

Very fun to teach and is great for table-talk, but among a group of experienced players the base game falls apart and tends to become rng heavy. I've never played with expansions, so the experience may improve with those additions.|13|Catan

58164|manly duckling|7.0|I finally got round to buying and playing this old warhorse. I was afraid it would be too simple and boring for the family. The wife felt that it went on too long (our first game took about 2 hours) but our son enjoyed gathering the resources and victory points. I can see the influence on other games. First play verdict: a good game but perhaps slightly too luck driven. Update after several plays: kids really enjoy playing it, wife feels it drags, I tolerate it and quite enjoy it but can see myself tiring of it soon.|13|Catan

58654|Brother Abe|7.0|Never gonna be my favorite but it a pretty decent game.  My family plays my modified rules, which allows several games to be played...basically my gripe was you get stuck and have to wait for everyone who is getting resources to finish. Mod: As in Knights you get a city at start up. You can trade any card rather than all of one resource.  Robber and knight card can steal, but can also just get whatever recsource you put the robber on, pasture gives on sheep card. It of course still blocks the number until moved.  That adds velocity to the game and makes it as interesting I think.  But we play friendly.|13|Catan

58699|JVgamer|7.0|Ah! Catan, the game that started it all, right? I will never say no to a game of Settlers and its expansions. For what it is — a game for both family and serious play — it scores a 9, I suppose. However, I knocked it down to 7 for my tastes because I believe the game requires the expansions to fulfill my stronger game desires; I now prefer playing with both the Seafarers and Cities & Knights expansions, with 19 points to win, to make an epic game session.|13|Catan
58700|ooba|7.0|"I did not try Catan until very late in my boardgame journey\lifecycle. I had planned Lisboa, Terra Mystica a long time before I sat down for the first game of this. My expectations weren't too high since you always hear some gamers go ""Oh Catan"" and some complaint about the game. (Has not aged well, too random etc.)  Pleasantly surprised by the game - personally, I think its just the right amount of randomness - the fun kind. Even 20+ years after its release, the design does not feel old. Do yourself a favour and give it a go if you haven't already."|13|Catan

58958|BobaFett912|7.0|Catan has comfortably established itself as a classic board game. The original game is well constructed, and in general players will find this game very replayable. The length and complexity of the game suits most gamers and casual parties. For the true Catan fanatic there are dozens of expansions and spinoffs to add variety of the well established formula. If you want to play Catan, but you only have 2 players, pick up the card game Rivals for Catan instead. While probably not the most exciting or captivating board game in your collection, Catan is a great option that most players will be excited to play time and time again.|13|Catan

59112|FroggyLicks|7.0|"There is no way that this game deserves the hate it gets. While it may not be a fresh out of the furnace New York pizza, it sure isn't airplane pizza either. It's a solid entry level game made for people to play and have a nice time talking and laughing at bad/good dice rolls. It's about being the ""King of the Bricks"" or the evil road bandit who cuts everyone off. It's a game where you remind your friend about that one time you helped him recover from a drunken stupor so he should give you some ore.   While it may be annoying to lose dice roll after dice roll or to see someone become insanely rich, the game isn't about being perfectly balanced as all things should be. It's comparing Hearthstone to Magic the Gathering. Hearthstone is simpler and based around RNG and if you don't accept that, you'll tilt and hate the game."|13|Catan

59351|Zmajor|7.0|A classic. Albeit slow, and heavily luck based. But...  A few changes and house rules, change the game for the better.  1. Use the better settlers app for set up 2. Combine #'s (2&3) and (11&12) on the respective hexes. (Make your own token of you must and put 3 dots for probability) 3. Robber doesn't get activated for 2 turns. 4. When a 7 is rolled (or drawn[see#7 on this list]) that player gets to roll or draw again, if another 7, then ignore it and then next persons turn. So the person rolling a 7 gets another production roll, in order to get the game moving. 5. Victory point cards have to be automatically revealed. Or remove victory point cards all together (preferred) and decrease points to 8 or 9. (Last few rounds become a drag when more players involved, and victory point cards cause a very unclimactic win). 6. Print the harbor master card (2 points for the most harbor settlements, and you need 3 harbor points to attain it [a city counts as two and a settlement counts as 1]) and use it like the longest road card.  And additionally a player can't have all 3 of the cards (longest road, largest army, and harbor master) if a player at any point does acquire all 3 they have to choose which 2 to keep. 6. 20 second timer on trades. 7. Get rid of the dice and build a deck of cards using 2 deck of playing cards. Shuffle and draw each turn. When five 7's are drawn, reshuffle. (Build the deck: Put in six-7's, five-6&8 each, four-5&9 each, three-4&10 each, two-11&3 each and one-2&12 each ( 3 if you combine 2&3 and 11&12). 8. On a 5 or more player game, get rid of the special build phase and increase robber threshold fo 8 for 5 players, 9 for 6 players.|13|Catan

59354|GamesRGames|7.0|There isn't much to say about this one, but the dice are actually really bad in it. I find it essential to use the event cards from the Traders and Barbarians expansion so that I'm not cursing my luck all game. It's quite possible that the benefit these cards give me is entirely psychological, but I'll keep using them all the same.|13|Catan

59516|rcyo88|7.0|Irony. Disappointing at first but not because of the game.  I was told in college that Catan is too complicated for me and the second time I tried, it wasn't explained very well. So, I felt discouraging to play. Catan did seem too complicated. Determined that it must be fun, I bought the game and taught myself how to play. Then, I found a new set of friends- it was indeed fun.   Then, it got frustrating...  In my gaming group, the seasoned players are more cutthroat, not willing to trade very much, making the game  feeling like the only way to win is to stay in second and pretend that you are losing. I shelved Catan until I got E&P. Much better.  I would rate Catan a 6, but the E&P moves it to the next level- 7.  .:Best 3-4:.  -- Expansion // The Fishermen- Expands the board spaces to the edge, literally, and with the harbormaster, it's another path to victory. // Explorers & Pirates- robber is less punishing, more traveling.|13|Catan

59544|takeoutweight|7.0|"Catan (base-game, no expansions) is actually Quite Great. There is highly interactive board play, tasteful application of randomness (luck ""scales with skill"" and doesn't dwarf skill -- i.e. as player skill increases the percentage of wins thrown by chance remains constant.) The game has the minimal amount of rules necessary to give the various resources character and you even get a bit of subtle diversification and shared incentives.  Initial settlement placement is a bit too consequential and chaotic for me to consider this game top-tier."|13|Catan

I find that a lot of today's games are very convoluted, and I'm not a fan of that; I have a lot more fun with the simpler strategy games like Catan. I also like that it's very easy to learn, so you can start playing right away.|13|Catan

59892|rayr|6.99|"= 2012-05-21  The game that started it all. Some friends introduced us to this game in January of 2012 and now I have a BGG account, two shelves of board games and a wishlist that grows by three for every one I remove.  I won't say we've ""moved on"" from this game, but it hasn't had much play since being used as a gateway game. I blame this on us mostly wanting to play two player games and there are just so many better two player games out there than any two player variant of Catan.  = 2014-02-14 - R:6.99  Happy Valentine's Day. In sticking with the theme for the day, I'd like to share some love for this game. I gave it a 6 because, on the official BGG scale, it's a game I admire but would only play when in a certain mood. That mood is more situational than anything. There are many times when my wife and I want to play a game together and we'd like that game to have the feel of Catan, but so far we haven't been able to capture that feel in a two player game. When we do have enough people over to be able to play a four player game, I rarely want to play board games. So poor Catan never makes it to our table even though I think I want to play it. In honor of how much Catan influences our search for other games, I'm bumping the rating from 6 to 6.99."|13|Catan

59956|Kenchana|6.9|堅実なゲーム。いくつか点数の取り方があり、運もあり、交渉もあり・・・でも、それに慣れるまで時間がかかる。まだ回数を重ねていないので、毎回何かのルールを間違える。たとえば、街を建てる場所、７の処理のカード上限。堅実なゲームであるので、ルール間違えがあると自分の中では、失敗と思ってしまう。統計データで、プレイの難易度も2.4もある。やはり、初心者にはルールが多い。 もう一つ、やはりダイスの運に泣かされるのがキライ。上級者は最初の段階で最適な場所とりが完了しているので、面白いかもしれないが、初心者はそれも良くわからない。上級者は、最初の陣地とりが頭を使う・・・というが、言い換えれば、この陣地とりで決まり、あとはおまけ？なのだろうか、と思ってしまう。|13|Catan

I like that a lot as there is no set strategy; you have to adapt to the game at hand.  Even with that though, the game is starting to feel like a lot of the same thing.  Maybe an expansion will liven things up again for me?  I did really like it the first dozen or so times I played it.  We'll see...|13|Catan

60224|patchwerq|6.75|One snow week in January 2011 we had a week of playing the classics (Settlers, Alhambra, Princes of Florence, and Louis XIV). We pulled Settlers off the shelf and played it again. We had a great time relearning the rules and enjoying the game again.   The game is a simple medium weight game. The game is very luck driven due to the roll of the die and resource collection. |13|Catan
60225|Eclectic Minnesotan|6.75|Not terribly impressed with the box and component quality.  The frame and tiles always pop up at one corner or another and are thinner and less rigid than I have seen in other games.  Quality would suggest a much lower SRP than $40.  Rather than being about building roads, settlements, etc, the games seems to be more about buying the development cards since you can build your army and collect free VPs.  Also, the robber is a little too powerful and comes into play too frequently.  I want to love this game and will keep playing it, but these features seem to cause a little too much tension at the table.|13|Catan
60226|Boots01|6.75|2010: An absolute classic, and still one of the best-balanced games I have ever played. Improved greatly by the addition of Cities and Knights, though the base game is well-worth playing. Rated 7.5  EDIT 2017: Played again ecently, boy this one is starting to show its age. Dropped rating to 6.75 |13|Catan

60231|dialing_wand|6.75|This game was what got the whole board-game madness started. While it's still a bit too dice-driven for my liking, I still play it with friends almost once a week and enjoy it very much.   While it might only deserve 8/10 geekles, I have it a +1 for being close to my heart.  Settle on!|13|Catan

60233|mrbrefast|6.75|"I changed my January 2011 rating of 7.9 down to 6.75 on 5/4/16, to reflect what I have been telling people for years - this is an excellent ""gateway drug"" game for getting people into the board gaming hobby, but it just isn't that much fun to me any longer.  A combination of expansionism and rolling dice, with a rudimentary card system on the side, this game is lean and mean.  Expand your abstract cities and roads based on the accrual of 4 resources; and do so in a way that makes life harder for the other folks on the board.  Many fundamental Euro game principles at play here, and thus many prospective gamers find it to be delightful.   (Written 5/4/16)"|13|Catan

60244|Sandbagging|6.75|Like for many people, this was my gateway game; I remember holding the rulebook for the first time and thinking how impressive it was that any game could have so much material to learn.  I had a lot of fun with the game and introducing it to all my friends allowed me to bring them into the hobby with me.  Now, the game only gets played occasionally.  Is it a good game?  I think so, I guess, but I don't feel particularly compelled by it anymore.  I may have become too familiar with it, and maybe the same thing would happen with some of my current favourites if I were to play them as much and as often as I did Catan, but I have a feeling the games that I now rank among the best have a little something, or maybe a few things, that Catan just doesn't bring to the table.|13|Catan

60263|cazaron|6.75|Catan's pretty much the game that everyone gravitates to once they go past 'classics' like Monopoly, Cluedo or Risk. It's a game that while I do enjoy playing, grinds me a lot. Once you know you're just not going to win, it's a 30-60 minute grind of rolling, trading and building in a futile attempt to salvage something from a lost position. It is a good game though, I just have many better games to choose in a situation where Catan would be played.|13|Catan

60299|GreekGeek87|6.75|"Who I play this with:  I played this with my Fiancée and her brother a few times before I started getting more modern games. Used to play this a lot with family friends back in the day.  When & what I bought:  This is one of the first games I got in late 2017/early 2018 when I started developing the collection - just before I started really researching modern board games and realized how much this was out of date...  What makes this game unique for me:  I used to love this and play it a lot with family friends. However, I don't want to play it anymore because Ticket to Ride, Mission: Red Planet or Downforce (just to name a few) are way better Gateway games. Plus, a lot of people own this so I'll get a chance to play it when I'm at other people's place.  Rating & classification:  6.75/10 - consider culling  This isn't a bad game, but it's outdated. I have better gateway games. This will probably be one of the first ""yellows"" to turn into a ""red"" because I feel like I'm just through with it."|13|Catan

60315|rynelf|6.7|--05Aug2004-- Bumped down to 7 due to increasing grumpiness with the effect of roll distributions on results.  While this is a really good gateway game - particularly for people that have been exposed to classic roll&move fare - there simply aren't enough rolls of the dice in a given game to even out a typically lumpy distribution.  As a result, a theoretically 'good' play can easily fail to be rewarded.  In the face of superior competition, then; there are other things that I would rather play.  ++ >20 unlogged plays. ++|13|Catan

Es cierto, se tiene control en varias decisiones, donde colocar tus asentamientos y expandirte, pero hay partidas que definitivamente las probabilidades te juegan tan mala pasada que sientes que no tienes control de nada, el rezago del último jugador es bastante triste.  Eso si, no es aburrido, es un buen juego para 4 jugadores de duración media, aunque creo que si durara 1 hora cumpliría mejor su rol, con duraciones de 1 hora y 30 o 2 horas pierde gracia.|13|Catan

60467|hackryder|6.5|"Still one of the best ""gateway"" games if you're trying to branch out from Sorry, Monopoly, Clue, or party games.  Over time if you find that you love this game and start playing more Euros, you may find that the luck element in Catan can occasionally make the game miserable for someone playing. The rich get richer if you are left far behind by bad dice rolling, and don't gain any resources, and are then not someone anyone wants to trade with. This chain reaction can lead to someone watching everyone else play Settlers of Catan.   That said, this was the game that launched me into Eurogames, and I'll always play it with a group of new initiates to the hobby."|13|Catan

60590|ERPriest|6.5|Despite all the criticism here on BGG, I generally enjoy this game.  One can see immediately why it is considered the quintessential gateway game: it has loads of player interaction and involvement and with resource collection and trading occurring for everyone each turn, everyone stays engaged.  I particularly like that the momentum builds as the game progresses, and when there is not a runaway leader, it is sometimes not clear who will win as the end approaches.  Settlers is clearly a classic deserving of all of its fame.  Having said that, with time I have downgraded my rating from an 8 to a 6.5, as dependency on the dice rolls make's it difficult to control one's destiny, and there sometimes can be a real runaway leader problem.|13|Catan

Still want to play more, though. :)  29/12/05 update: Played three-player with food stamps yesterday and it was a much better experience.

60615|chinkee|6.5|decent game, but nothing special.  I don't enjoy the type of interaction with trading the cards.  The interaction is similar to bohnanza in a way.  The use of dice combined with the trading aspect make this game for casual gamers.  There isn't much strategy involved and the players don't have much control over the anything unless they are willing to form alliances, collude with other players, be well liked enough.  3 of the most important aspects (trading of supplies, moving the robber, rolling of dice) are out of the player's control to an extent, which is why I don't care much for the game.

60644|Favre4MVP|6.5|I don't hate Settlers, but I could live without it. The thing that kills it for me is the fact that a player can be stuck with nothing to do turn after turn and there's nothing they can do about it. I don't mind luck in games, but when it reduces a player to a spectator, then I'd rather play something else.  The thing that I think bothers me even more than that is the playing time. I could live with the luck if this was a 45 minute game. In fact, if this was a 45 minute game I'd probably love it. |13|Catan

Settlers expands fairly well, except that there is almost always one player (sometimes 2) left in the dust with nothing to do but play kingmaker (or breaker).  If this person is a newcomer, it can be disheartening.  Also, expanding to 5 or 6 with Settlers can really lengthen the game, which sometimes leads to concessional trades in order to end the game sooner.|13|Catan

Dice rolls, trading deals, card draws, and the placement of the thief make this game very lucky. I might enjoy it more, now that I understand the mechanics better, but I have a feeling the luck factor will keep Catan from getting to the table much.  Sold it off more because of quality than anything else. If there was a deluxe version with a way to mitigate luck, maybe I'll reconsider.|13|Catan

60731|The Barefoot Killer|6.5|It's an ok game, but I'm not much a fan for a few reasons:  1) the initial settlement placements are by far the biggest influence on the final outcome, making the rest of the game sometimes feel like a slog,  2) luck of the dice and card draws become too much of a boom and bust for the players, becoming another major factor on the final outcome,  3) there's inconsistent capacity for player agency in that a player who suffers from a bad run of dice rolls really can't do anything while a player who benefits from a good run can build an insurmountable position,  4) 90 minutes is simply too long for a strategy game that's more about luck than player decisions.  I'd like to try it with Cities & Knights to see if that wins me over.  (UPDATE: I wouldn't say it won me over but I do think it adds some good stuff.)|13|Catan

Settlers feels like an awkward High School Romance that just sorta faded away, never had an explosive/dramatic break-up, You both know its over but it doesn't stop you from wondering if there [i]wasn't something there.[/i]|13|Catan

60918|themightysrc|6.5|At one time, no gaming get together was complete for my group without yet another game of Settlers (with expansions). Such was the enthusiasm that they readily embraced any new add-on and quirks and took them to their hearts, leaving me increasingly baffled, as the full house Settlers with everything added in is barely less complicated and slower than allegedly 'difficult' games that they constantly shied away from!  However, once everyone had had at least one game where they were squeezed into a tiny area of the board, with no hope of winning and some hours to go, the magic well and truly wore off.  It's a nice little game for 5, poor for 6 and too limited for 4 or fewer.|13|Catan

All of my friends, even those that think board games are lame, LOVE this game.  We had more success getting people to play this game repeatedly than anything else I have seen.  There is plenty to do and though the game is pretty straight forward, the difference in peoples desire to trade and ever changing game board, this game has a lot of replayability.  Most on here recommend against 6 players, but I think the expansion is great.  It is always nice to have more seats open at the table...|13|Catan

I only see myself playing this again if using a variant to mitigate the luck of the dice roll (e.g. Giving players a token each time a roll gives nothing to them, so later they might chance 10 of said tokens for any one resource). Otherwise, this game would be broken in my opinion.   Definitely I won't play this again using  the official rules. |13|Catan

However, with repeated plays the power of the dice becomes apparent and the fun factor wore down quickly.  I've played this dozens of times at this point, and while I'll play again if asked, I prefer games with more opportunity for decision-making and strategy (like Agricola). |13|Catan

It's nice that this makes the game progress, and it adds some underhanded conflicts to a seemingly low-conflict game - but I really don't like how this makes you unable to recover from mistakes.  But then, I only played the game like three times, and a long time ago. My assessment meanwhile might change. But I still do like games where it's possible to grab land from each other after and counteract against a strike of luck, and Settlers doesn't appear to easily allow that.|13|Catan

But I won't be adding it to my collection for the following reasons:  1. I usually like a deeper game than this one. 2. Enough of my friends own it that I don't need to own it.  I can see it's appeal. But not for me.|13|Catan

Maybe I've just had odd games, but so much depends on the dice rolls and the game can quickly become very boring if your numbers just won't come up (even if you've positioned well!).  So much is determined by the initial placement that, having played it a few times, it often feels like we're just playing out a predetermined script after the first settlements go down.|13|Catan

First, it was the sense of futility that we got when we realized that our initial settlement placements had been sub-par; we'd spend the rest of the game as non-contenders, having no fun.  We started using the 'welfare' variant and found that it gave us a much greater feeling of control and made bad-for-us rolls seem much less punishing. It saved Catan for us, and we wouldn't play without it.|13|Catan

61365|ranapuer|6.5|I understand the significance this has had for our hobby, but for me, the runaway leader problem kills this one. Someone can get boxed in with no decent expansion possibilities and have no hope of winning literally over an hour before the game ends. I understand this only happens when someone makes mistakes during the early turns, but if we're using this as an introductory game, it is very possible that someone's first experience with European-style board gaming involves putting down some starting settlements and then getting surrounded and feeling powerless for the rest of the game. That is board gaming at its worst; is that really what we want our first impression to be?  Historical rating: 10 Gameplay rating: 6  EDIT: After reading several interviews with designer Klaus Teuber, I can say that his presence in the games industry is an absolutely wonderful thing, and I admire his attitude and actions. I wish I liked his game more, but I have no trouble liking the man himself.  Klaus Teuber rating: 10/10|13|Catan

61409|mattgoal|6.5|"Still one of my favorites.  More ""hardcore"" gamers would scoff at that, but it has a lot of what I like in a game.  It is social (trading). All players are involved in every turn (dice rolls and trading). There is enough luck to make it interesting but enough skill that experience/strategy matters.  The theme is light-hearted and doesn't turn people off (a great thing for a gateway game).  On the downside, trading can be intimidating for new players.  The range in game time is actually fairly substantial.  Someone always seems to complain about the random board.  There is a lot of sheep on the board for it not meaning much (the Seafarers expansion helps with that)."|13|Catan

61564|Darla|6.5|21-Mar-2014  I feel like I'm missing something with this game that seems to be hugely popular that I feel is reasonably fun to play but nothing spectacular.  I find if one player starts to pull ahead on victory points it's too hard to catch them up and stop them winning.  How you place your settlements at the start of the game is crucial. If you make a poor job of that then it can screw your whole game up and makes it very difficult to recover.  Edit 06-Mar-2017 With hindsight I feel I judged this game a little too harshly!  Settlers of Catan is over 20 years old and in that context it's a groundbreaking game.  It's a very good gateway game, but it's starting to show its age a little nowadays.|13|Catan

61615|sdrawkcabmai|6.5|I'm torn. Settlers was the game that got me over the mainstream board game hurdle of boring themes, humdrum mechanics, and player elimination. Settlers also introduced me to variable boards, wooden pieces, and victory points. But... Settler's role as a gateway game also hurts it in the long run because there are so many more games out there that really make Settlers feel kind of, well, boring. I only play this now if I am in a very specific mood. And if there aren't better games within reach.|13|Catan

I'm not 100% sure it deserves its supposed classic status but I can see its appeal as a gateway game. There are much more fun family games out there and far deeper euros... but not many that attempt both.   I find the theme a bit too dry.  Edit: just got bored of it. Sold.|13|Catan

62093|thelastemperor|6.5|I like Catan, but I'm just not super excited about playing it because there are so many things I'd rather play. The chance of the dice rolling doesn't bother me in and of itself so much as the fact that really the whole game boils down to that, it seems. I also wish there was more meat in the diplomacy aspects and more potential for direct competition and conflict. The Cities & Knights expansion is a must.  That said, it's a good game and a lot of fun and I enjoy the social aspect of trading. I also like that it has such broad appeal. If everyone and their uncle didn't own a copy, I might want to own it more badly. Maybe some day.  In the end, I find myself neither wanting to sing Catan's praises (the people who are like OMG, CATAN IS THE BEST/ONLY BOARD GAME), but nor do I totally get all the hate it gets from the pretentious board-game elitists.|13|Catan

62096|chaogene|6.5|I can't say I don't like the game... But there's one thing I really hate about this game... the feeling you have of not doing anything when the dices are not rolling for you. When it's YOUR turn to play and you can't do anything... no one wants to trade with you... you just watch everyone else play... that says everything.  I think the expansions changed that feeling. You have more control on you destiny, there are more ways to win. I enjoy playing Seafarers expansion. I wouldn't play without it now.  A good introduction game for new players.  I have a mixed feeling about this game. Still eager to play when someone suggests it... but do not enjoy every game of it.|13|Catan

I've had some annoying games where people manipulate others in trades or just give away their cards for next to nothing near the end of the game if they feel they are not going to win.  Granted, that is a problem with the group.  But it still makes this one group-dependent for me.  |13|Catan

It is not completely balanced and all the time it seemed that 3,4,10 and 11 are more frequent than 6 or 8. But the amount of back-stabbing is rather small compared to the more ""competitive"" games."|13|Catan

62197|andrewleafman|6.5|One of the best games for introducing people to board games, since Settlers is simple, short, and has a fun trading dynamic. Unfortunately the strategic element is lacking and the game is completely dominated by dice rolls. It's appropriate for a relaxed, not intense gaming environment, but don't expect the game to confront you with many difficult choices.  The cooperative trading element of the game almost always breaks down near the end, because once someone is close to winning everyone else refuses to trade with that person.|13|Catan

62316|Leeroy1|6.5|A classic game known to many, an unfortunate symbol of geek culture that can turn off many non-gamers. It's a game that's fine, nice mechanics like resource management and trading, multiple avenues to win. But the game is right down to luck: who gets to place their places in the best positions for resources at the very start, what dice rolls happen and who gets those resources, and who gets robbed the most etc. This means the strategy is almost not there, but it's easy to get into, and it's not going to actively turn away people like a long game of Monopoly or Munchkin does. Perfectly fine gateway that I'll play whenever, but I just don't care enough to win since there's not that much you can do to control it.|13|Catan

I do prefer it with Cities & Knights because I think it offers a balance to the game, as with the base game it seems like a race to see you can build cities first (which usually means they win from my experience). I wish there were ways to mitigate the luck of the dice roll. |13|Catan

Once the Cities and Knights expansion came out, the strategy to winning the base game become too straight-forward. Still an excellent gateway game to new players.|13|Catan

62420|Prefection|6.5|Gateway game for me just like most people.  It isn't a bad game.  I actually like playing it online more than in person for some reason.   I think it might be with not having to deal with setup and online the pace is much faster.   If the pace is kept up, it helps with the fact that you don't really have that many choices that you can make each turn.  The game doesn't play you but you definitely are not overwhelmed with possibilities, which is probably why it is a gateway game.   I have played the shit out of it online so my enthusiasm for it is probably a little muted. I know I have more plays of it than any other game.  It isn't a bad game by any stretch.  There are just other games that have similar mechanisms and are better.  I would give the game a solid 7.  There is nothing wrong with the game, I have kind of just played it out.|13|Catan

62425|smcshaw|6.5|One of the few games I've kept from before my new game renaissance. I'll never suggest it, but, with the one expansion I have, Seafarers, it has still shown itself to be fun when it does come out. Interesting tit-bit though: It's only the children that do ever suggest it, and we feel it always out-stays its welcome. I can't recall a game without my wife and I looking at each at some point with the 'please, one of us win soon' eyes...|13|Catan

62490|chenproton|6.5|一片蔚蓝的海洋里，有一个孤单而美丽的小岛，它的名字叫catan。 小岛鸟语花香，四季如春，处处生机盎然。草地上白白的绵羊成群栖息，森林里参天的大树直入云霄，肥沃的土地上金黄的麦穗随风翻滚，坚硬的石头小山，为所有的生命遮风挡雨。  有一天，远远地从海上飘来几页白帆，几个长相各异的人，来到了这片世外桃源，他们惊异于这小岛的丰富资源和美丽风景，每个人都想独霸一方，开拓领地，他们就是settlers。  可是catan只是大洋中的一个孤岛，面积有限，资源有限。为了避免过度的争抢造成几败俱伤，settlers开始了一次初步建设行动。如果谁在这次初步行动中，依靠有计划的部署，能够第一个拿到10分，他就赢得了这场斗争的胜利，从此拥有了catan这块神奇的土地，其他settlers就甘愿引身而退。   卡坦岛 Catan (1995)  评分：7.2分  难度：2.35 / 5（轻度策略） 玩家人数：3—4人（最适合人数4人） 游戏时长：60-120分钟|13|Catan

But she's asked for Catan for years, so this past Christmas I finally did some research and bought her a like-new 2012 printing of the 4th edition (same-size components and identical tiles to 5th edition, 75% of the price). But that same Christmas, her relatives bought her a brand-new 5th edition, and I found out 5th edition has beautifully illustrated resource cards! So we re-gifted the 4th-edition copy.|13|Catan

This game does not warrant expansions for me though, since I assume Cities and Knights is a longer game, and Pirates is just expensive. Base game is fine since I can find a playable copy anywhere I go. Edit: I prefer 5-6 players to 4. More interesting group dynamics that way|13|Catan

62894|elucidarian|6.25|[2016-05-31] I have a love/hate sense of this game. I want it to be better, but I'm not sure how to go about that.   1. Have the Robber default back to the Desert tile after one round anywhere else. He won't stay long to impede a runaway leader, but he also won't stall an already lagging player.  Trading can result in a more luck-driven, dice rolling grind if no one is willing to trade. Maybe there could be more incentive:   2. Players may draw a resource card token (per the Welfare variant rules) if they accepted a trade offer made by another player.  see also:  The famous WELFARE variant [url]https://boardgamegeek.com/article/1325958#1325958[/url]  Change luck for strategy: use 3 dice!!

Could be partly because of my first game, in which the owner did not explain the rules fully -- or well.  But I'm not big on trading games, which is the heart of this one. It really comes down to the group of players making or breaking the experience.  And it's a bit long for my taste.  If I ever do pick it up, it will probably be the Star Trek version, which has a more interesting theme to my, and some interesting power cards.|13|Catan

63224|kimapesan|6.0|I got a lot of enjoyment out of Settlers at one time. It just doesn't grab me much now. I've long thought that its mechanics of balancing cooperation with competition worked brilliantly, a very different kind of game from AmeriTrash's straight competition. But in repeated playing, games always reached a tipping point where there was no more trading, no more interaction, and it was a straight competition to get to the finish. Perhaps that's how it was designed to be. But it just doesn't leave enough variation to the pattern of the game. Eventually, I was willing to part with Settlers, knowing that it would not be hard to re-acquire if I wished to, in order to make room for something else in my collection.|13|Catan

63226|citizen k|6.0|This is a fun and easy to teach game.  Yet it can be unbalanced in favor of the player or two who get to place their settlements first.  Often the board layout is such that a few prime locations exist, with valuable geography under high probability numbers.  Players choosing later can be very hard pressed to win.  Add to this a rich-get-richer problem, and the source of our love-hate relationship with this classic become clear.  Most games have some element of chance, this game seems to exaggerate the role of chance.  I think the initial setup is a huge part of this exaggeration.|13|Catan

The number of die rolls in the whole game are low enough that I frequently saw peopl with 6, 7, and 8 tiles just painfully watch 11, 12, 4, 3, 2, come up on the dice and lose, lose, lose ...  It was still kind of fun, not a problem per se, just seemed to fill some nice in gaming culture that I never quite understood. I was playing Um Reifenbreite around the same time and somehow it appealed to me a lot - even mor eluck, but it never pretended otherwise, nor drew a huge following of worshippers and torunaments at game cons and so on, just a plain simple luck fest of a cycle racing game ;-)|13|Catan

63364|rayito2702|6.0|Settlers, Settlers, where to start.  In the late 90's I was looking for a board game that was better than, or at least equal to but different from, Talisman.  People kept telling about Settlers of Catan and I eventually found a copy at a local game store.  After playing it turned out to be a big dud.  I eventually got a copy of Robo Rally and that turned out to be the next best thing to Talisman at the time.  Back to Settlers, I had a copy of the game, didn't like it much, bought all the expansions (the local game store only had Warhammer, CCGs and Settlers so what else was there to buy?) to see if they would add that little spark to the game.  I became somewhat fond of the six player all expansions way of playing.  All my friends liked it so I ended up playing it quite a bit (my copy of the game is quite beat up).  Why didn't it work for me?  Because Catan is a negotiation game.  And when you play with people (myself included) that love to argue about the minutest detail even vanilla Catan can become a two hour slog.  The game is just not designed for the purpose of fierce competition.  It's a family game where people get to build cool houses and cities.  These things increase a player's ability to produce.  So you feel like you are doing something as the game progresses even if you lose...except for when you get a sequence of bad die rolls that allow your opponents to cut you off at the beginning of the game.  The game is quite simple: roll dice, produce goods, trade with your opponents, build.  It's thrilling as any dice game is.  Everyone is invested in every die roll so the game can provide a fun party-like atmosphere.  It's not the greatest game, nor is it particularly revolutionary, but it is fun, interactive, popular and allows players to build cool things.|13|Catan

The combination of this randomness and the tactical decisionmaking of the players (where to build, when to trade, when to take a chance on a card) in my opinion makes this a good but not great game.  Its ratings seem a bit inflated by the nostalgia of those for which this was the ""gateway"".

It's just a classic game in so many ways, from the randomized board to the resource trading, and it's so easy to play!  But the game bogs down during many trading sessions, and rolling dice every turn to determine who gets resource cards will ultimately leave some players sitting there WITH NOTHING TO DO for a few turns.

For that, I suppose I owe Klaus Teuber a debt (which I repaid by buying 4-5 expansions, Das Book, and the $400 ""chest"" version, plus 2 years on online play, and the Xbox version).  Played perhaps more than any game but Chess and Risk, hundreds of times online and on PC as well. I enjoyed this game, for a long time. Frustrated by poor setups, and bad runs of the dice, my solution was to play it more.  12/11/05 - after over 100 plays on MS site, 20-30 on BSW, and 30+ f-t-f, I am tiring of this game. It has it's place, but I wonder about it's affect now on some folks I've introduced it to. Is it better to get them hooked on PR, or PG? or PoF? I am winning 40+% of my online games, but what does this mean? I am clearly losing some games purely to chance, driving me to play more to counter-act this effect. But when I am winning, are others losing because of chance? How many decisions that I make really are decisions at all?  1/08 Dropping to a 6, but with no disrespect. 1/12 Dropping to a 5. Every year new stuff comes out that improves upon Settlers concepts. I do very much thank Klaus T. for designing this game and bringing me back into the hobby.  9/2014: My rating of 5 is simply my current desire to play. It in no way reflects how important this game was to me and my family. It literally brought me back in to hobby gaming, and had a strong hold on me for 10 straight years.

I own three editions of the game, the first two from Mayfair, featuring different colored tokens, enabling you to play with as many as 8 players, and then the Swedish edition and 5-6 player expansion. Mayfair's double-island scenario really rocks.  Contains pieces in the following colors:  * Black * Blue * Green * Orange * Purple * Red * White * Yellow|13|Catan

63586|Cruelsader|6.0|Classic. Good social game, although a bit too much luck dependent.

It's a very good game for a bunch of inexperienced players since they will have lots of fun turning sheep into wood.|13|Catan
63609|matthewjhoskins|6.0|I have a love-hate relationship with Catan. The game re-ingnited my interest in board games in 1999/2000.

63612|theonomous|6.0|"The historically quintessential German gateway game, and also the one game I find in the hands of people who have heard of little more than Monopoly.  It was the first game I bought when I decided to get serious about collecting German-style games, but I'm getting a bit worn out on it as I get deeper into the territory.    9-2-08: Have to move this down to a 6.  I appreciate what this game has accomplished, but I've thought about trading my copy and would, were it not for the sake of respect, nostalgia, and some degree of hope that I'll find some resurgence in interest through one of the expansions, or the right group, or what have you.  As it is, can't think of a time when I wanted to pull it out even for old time's sake, and I'll even try to avoid playing it.  That probably means I should rate it a 4.  I'm not one to rag on a game just because it's popular, so that's not ""it.""  I think, at the risk of being inconsistent, it's ultimately the dice that do me in on this one.  I generally don't mind games which rely so heavily on dice rolling, but this is one that can really make me look at my watch if lady luck is canoodling with one of my rivals--there seems to be too little I can do in too long of a game.    12-24-07: Played the game again recently on Xbox Live.  Maybe it's the extra options, the built-in session report, the detailed statistics tracking, or the sense of playing with an  animated version of the collector's edition, but I give it an extra point over the base board game.

UPDATE:  Lowered from an 8 because, since moving on to more euro games, I've NEVER come back to this...not once.  And, since becoming more aware of the current board-game scene, I can't believe so many people consider a game so heavily based on player-to-player free-form trading to be such a good gateway game.  I often times have a tough time getting my ""non-gamers"" to follow the very specific basic rules of a game, let alone making up free-form trade offers based on resource needs that they don't understand yet."|13|Catan

Still, it's something everyone should play, at least once, if only because so many other games build off some of the concepts in Settlers.|13|Catan
63619|Audacon|6.0|Definitely a gateway game for many people.  With 4 experienced players, it can play out very quickly and when this is done, the game really shines.  If the game play starts to drag, the play experience will definitely go down.  It is still highly playable, but perhaps a bit too much luck based for more modern strategy fans.  Planning for the luck element will mitigate all but the most die-hard opponent of the game.  [GTI Code: TPCL]|13|Catan

Luck in the dice rolls can have a big impact, though it is sort of balanced with the thief, which acts as a ""bash the leader"" mechanism.   Its luck factor gives the impression to have a larger impact than the one it actually has.

Better might have been to let 7 be some other action, and make the robber a less common roll, like 2 or 12, say.

63717|godfeather|6.0|For many players this is the introduction game to the hobby, but not for me as I learn to enjoy euros through other games. That is maybe why I don’t have the same nostalgia associated with this game as many other gamers. The game is fairly straightforward to explain, where the phases are distinct and simple. During the game there is usually not much thinking about how to use your resources, but there is definitely an amount of resource management.  What it comes down to in most game in my experience is two things, die rolling and initial set up. If you get your machine going in the beginning of the game you are hard to stop. The robber is simply not enough to stop and by not trading with him you might lose out on that too. That is also my main complaints about the game; there is too much luck and circumstances.   I like to play this game with either 3 or 4 players. With 4 players the board is a little tighter, so players can be shut-in, but that is generally in the end game anyway.|13|Catan

I find the boardgame a bit boring sometimes since the chances of getting the right resources seem to be smaller than in the card game, thus resolving in situations where the players do nothing but roll the dice for resource and then their turn ends. But then again, these two games are quite diffrent from eachother and there's nothing wrong with the board game, though I DO prefer the cards...|13|Catan

63907|Noah Kolman|6.0|I have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride with Settlers.  Like many others, this was the first Euro-style board game that I played, and it opened my eyes to a whole new way to game and a whole new type of game to play.  For that alone, it holds a special place in my heart.  I played this game almost exclusively for a year or more, and then became burned out on it.  There was a point when I didn't want to play it anymore.  But now that I play it with much more moderation, my opinion of it has increased again.  It has some great strategic decisions when it comes to placing your initial pieces, and the player interaction and replayability are fantastic.  You are certainly at the mercy of the dice in this game, and it is also possible that a player who is not winning can suffer when the other players jump on the leader, merely by sharing a space or two with the leader.  The game is not perfect, and sometimes a particular session just falls flat.  But the fact is that this is a great gateway game with a lot of strategy and a good dose of fun.  In reasonable amounts, it is quite enjoyable.|13|Catan

63950|thnikkaman|6.0|"This is the game that got me to love board games.   After this game gatewayed me to other designer games the fire to play has diminished severely.  Fun for a social environment, or if used as a gateway game.  Repeated playings will show the few number of real decisions for a player in the course of an hour.  I now think of it more as a party game,  and compare it to Apples to Apples and Scattergories.   This game holds its own.  Don't mess with the expansions or other ""Things of Catan"".  This is the gem.  The modular board and random placement of chits does not infuse a ton of replayability.  The strategies are the same, it just toggles the strength of them slightly.  The reason I probably over rank it based on my current desire to play it is with new players its way too slow for what the game has to offer, and with players who can get at this quickly there are games I enjoy more I'd rather be playing.  With that being said,  with a couple of cold ones the pacing of a snail does lead to a nice casual very social experience so I can't imagine ever turning down a game of vanilla settlers.  I gave it a whirl after it's been ages sinces I've fired this up.  It is still a good game, but not one of my favorites."|13|Catan

63976|leungd|6.0|"We have not yet played this with three or four players yet, so I can't give it a fair rating.  We tried many of the two player variants found here, but none of them really worked for us.  Probably the most fun part, the trading, was virtually non-existent.  As a result, the game became a basic resource/building game without too many frills.  However, there was a significant runaway leader ""rich gets richer"" problem---the first person to get a city saw their resources start to take off well beyond the other player.  There were few ways for the second player to come back.  There were a few games where the robber was parked solely on the losing player's side for most of the game.  As a result, this left a bad taste and drove us away from all things Catan for a long time (which we regretted since there [i]are[/i] some quite good two player Catan games).

63990|jttm|6.0|Everyone says this is a great gateway game for non-gamers, but I have never found that to be the case. The game itself is pretty basic and extremely dependent on luck. There always appears to be one logical choice of action given your hand of cards, and given your roll. The trading element is extremely dependent on the group you game with. New gamers tend to trade not at all since they are unsure of the value of things.  [UPDATE] After further playings, I'm lowering the score.

The actual mechanics are easier to see than explain on paper; the turns take just about the right length for me and give you interesting enough things to do. Of course, the hole you may be digging for yourself is your own grave as you drop further and further behind if you don't start off fairly strong or at least competitive. The midgame on can feel like a total drag if you're just treading water without much way of improvement.  The new Mayfair version is pretty nice, and there's absolutely no reason to get the older one instead. However, there's very little reason *to* get the new one if you have the old one unless sliding tiles was a real annoyance for you. In fact, I'm not sure how well the puzzle pieces will wear over time, and it wasn't that easy to get the hexes in it around the edges.|13|Catan

In a 4-player game, 1 player inevitably gets stuck at 4 VP's, doesn't produce much, and sits there with almost nothing to do for 45+ minutes. Not a great time.  With 3 players the board is more open, but trading is harder with only 2 trading partners.  With 5, the board is once again open, but building on every turn makes the 7-card max basically worthless  6 is too long and too crowded.  Cities/Knights is excruciatingly long, and Seafarers adds some stuff that's basically the same as the base game, only played on blue hexes.|13|Catan

The trouble is that in most games that I played it was clear after 30min who would win, yet it took another 90 min just to find out for sure. Phew! The game is ok if all participating players know the game well and are clever enough to set themselves up properly. It is usually bad for the entire game if someone manages to have both initial settlements on the same big number - for either this player will win if that number occur es often or that player wont stand a chance if the number occurs not all. |13|Catan

64157|VolcanoLotus|6.0|Does a lot of things well, in particular the fairly open trading rules, but there are two major issues I can't get past. First, there's enough strategy that you have to play well to win, but the dice add just enough randomness that the best strategy often will lose to a decent one. I've lost games I should have won due to dice, and worse still, I've won games I had no right winning because of them. In some ways, this is almost more irritating to me than games that are mostly luck, because it gives you the illusion that your strategy matters. As of this writing, the most recent game I played is a good example of this. I was on two 9 hexes of the same resource, which I had a 2:1 harbor for. Another player was on several of the 6s and 8s, and had high probabilities for all resources - but no 9s. We proceeded to roll something like 7 9s in 10 turns, allowing me to rally and take the lead to win. Some might call that risk/reward; for me, that was a hollow victory. My bigger problem with the game is that the structure makes it so that some players may face a fate worse than elimination: being mathematically eliminated from victory but forced to sit through until the end of the game anyway. Some have argued that a shrewd trader can still come back, but it's very apparent when someone cannot do it themselves, so only a pity trade could help them, and nobody likes a pity trade. This probably sounds overly negative, and it's probably a testament to the rest of the design that I still give it a 6 after all that complaining. Those two points are pretty much the only faults I have with the game itself. (Mayfair's pricing practices are another matter...)|13|Catan

Il gioco ha regole semplicissime, e c'è moltissima interazione tra i giocatori: oltre alla possibilità di sgambetto (col brigante e con la semplice occupazione territoriale) c'è lo scambio di materiali, indispensabile perché all'inizio è difficile essere indipendenti. Il gioco è enormemente influenzato dal fattore-culo (anche se la distribuzione normale dei tiri di dado aiuta chi non si distraeva alle lezioni di statistica), ma rimane godibile e leggero. Da giocare quando si ha fretta - anche se allo scopo ci sono in giro titoli migliori - o per catturare nella spirale dei giochi da tavolo gli amici non praticanti. Nota negativa: nella versione italiana la spiegazione delle regole è demenziale.|13|Catan

64327|wgambler2|6.0|Considered along with Puerto Rico to be one of the classics.  Overall I like the theme and the approach to the game, the only thing that drives me crazy are the dice.  Despite long term probability the dice in settlers seem to enjoy tormenting players, (myself at times especially) which seems to take the game from having strategy to mainly having luck which I don't like.  I certainly like having a random element in games, I just think in settlers the dice have more influence than they should.|13|Catan

64336|Barkam|6.0|This is a 10 if played with dice decks instead. It has the bell curve for planning, trading/robber for interaction, and some blocking for cut throat play. Just a magnificent package, except for the dice!   Update: 4-16-2007 This is the game that got me into this hobby.  I loved it and even played this 2 player and still loved it.  I thought it was the greatest game ever in the world.  I don't know if it is a good or bad thing, but the aforementioned sentiments has passed.  I find the gameplay/strategies in this game to be elementary and dull.  Really, the only exciting thing going on the game is seeing where the dice will fall.  Those two bones greatly affect how you are going to do in the game.  Of course there are somethings you can do to help you out, but the luck in this game is significant.  This game is hard to rate as I respect it and have nostalgic baggage that comes with it but I just don't want to play it more than I have to. Update: 9 -> 6|13|Catan

You should try it at least once, since it's a classic and has some neat mechanics, but I much prefer Struggle for Rome, which uses the same mechanics in a more streamlined and directed way.  If you're going to play regular Catan, at least add Cities & Knights, which adds some more good decisions and available routes to resources (e.g. bonus cards).  |13|Catan

64388|ececec|6.0|A great gateway game, but also introduced me to a number of issues I have since judged all games by. A player should not be eliminated from a potential win by the beginning turns and a leader should not be able to continue his run towards victory so easily. Sure he can be robbed or denied a trade, but for such a cutthroat style of board setup, the actual chances to screw your neighbor are low.

Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently. Complexity: Family game = a game that is easy to teach and play. # of players: 4. Playing time: 90 mins. Player interaction: Trading. Competition for scarce resources - settlement locations. Targeting - placing the robber. Randomness: Medium - dice, but you can prepare for rolls to some extent.  Replayability: Medium. This is always a good experience and most people are fine to play again, but maybe not right away? There is some depth to explore. Fun: Good fun. Trading makes it highly interactive. It's fun when your numbers come up, less fun when they don't. Memorabiity: Not so high, it's still a VP engine that doesn't create stories.  Thematic integration: Weak. Components: Nice.  Who will like this: Family gamers.|13|Catan

There's nothing worse than waiting 15 minute before you can do anything because the right numbers didn't come up.  It's so strange that this is the ultimate gateway game. It guess it makes some sense from the perspective of complexity. It's got some interesting mechanics without being hard to learn. But it has such huge flaws. Every game seems to drag about 20 minutes too long. Careful planning can be ruined by unlucky dice rolls. And the difference between winning and losing is actually very subtle.

64516|slowcorner|6.0|"I was quite late to the Settlers party, and it's hard for me to have much historical appreciation for the old warhorse.  I get that it opened a lot of eyes to the Euro possibilities here in the States, but I just wasn't blown away.  I got my Gateway on playing Carcassone H&G and Ticket to Ride Europe, and that was enough to send me on my way.  By the time I got to Settlers, I was all, ""Oh.  That was...nice.""  The best part of this game is that it can be very social and very tense.  The worst part is when it's neither social nor tense.  The VERY WORST THING about Settlers is that you can go several rounds (or half the game) without doing anything on your turn.  Roll the dice, pass the dice.  Yuck.  Basically, I think that the set collection and building mechanics were improved upon quite a bit with the Ticket to Ride franchise.    I'll play this when my just-getting-into-gaming friends suggest it, but I'll never offer to play it again."|13|Catan

64521|crutan|6.0|Ah, the gateway game.  This was where it started for me, to a certain extent.  I like settlers.  The computer version is wonderful, as it removes setup completely, which can be somewhat arduous.  The random board aspect is both good and bad.  Occasionally the randomness is problematic, and that can lead to unbalanced resource distribution.  Still, a fun one.|13|Catan

64532|Justin Hamilton|6.0|"This is a fun game for what it is, and was my ""Euro"" gateway game.  I think that there is a lot wrong with this game, from the run-away-leader syndrome from getting lucky, to the sometimes extremely bleak availability of resources sometimes produced from a random set up, but I will still play it most of the time when my friends suggest it, often as filler between heavier games."|13|Catan
64533|byronczimmer|6.0|At one time, was the game of choice. It's sat on the shelf for quite some time now, because the trading aspect can make or break the game depending on who else is at the table.

64547|Torquin|6.0|A classic that completely deserves all the international awards (and commercial success) it received. Still, in my humble opinion, it did not stand the test of time very well. When compared to modern day classics, it suffers from a lack of options and the fact that it really only shines with three players (with four, one player runs out of building sites very, very quickly). Much, much better with the Cities & Knights expansion. As far as cosmetics are concerned, I much prefer the original version with its wooden components.|13|Catan

64549|signjc|6.0|Fun luck based game with some strategic decisions to be made.  Particularly important is the placement of your starting villages.  Good introduction to the hobby; however, I feel that this game wears thin with repeated playings.  Just revisited this one after a long hiatus, and the honeymoon is definately over.  I found myself bored shortly after the set-up.  Dropping Settlers down 1 point- I will play, but would rather be playing something else.|13|Catan

The first player to reach 3 harbour points gets the ""Harbour Master"" card and the 2 VP that go with it.

UPDATE: Actually it gets quite a lot of play as my wife and my brother g/f do enjoy it a lot.   UPDATE AND NOTE: I downgraded the rating as now I am only willing to play it with new people.

64594|selwyth|6.0|My gateway game. Still fun, because I never played the snot out of it, like a lot of other people did. Initial placement is everything. I don't like to play with 4 players, as it seems to screw up the end-game, and the extra negotiation and downtime can make it not worthwhile. One of my favorite things to do in all of board gaming is to plan for and play the Monopoly card.  4+2|13|Catan
64595|Bulwyf|6.0|"A fun game that our gorup likes to fall back on.  Sort of like our ""old Reliable"".  I really enjoy the trading and bargaining involved.  Yes the game has some luck elements but they are manageable.  It's a good game for introducing new players to the hobby.  Rating lowered to a 6.  All of the above still apply but I would add the following.  Never play any flavor of SoC with more than 4.  More than that and the game breaks down to the point of boredom.  Avoid playing with whiners or AP types.  And finally, only play base Settlers when you're teaching someone the game.  Seafarers and C&K are just plain superior."|13|Catan

64767|hinotori|6.0|"This was a completely new gaming experience when I first played this. There's a lot of luck with the resource generation, but it is really a matter of ""covering all the numbers"", or making sure you can generate/trade resources whenever you can. Easy to play, but filled with a wide range of strategies, and just the right amount of luck. I've used this as a gateway game to convert several Scrabble die-hards into enthusiastic Settlers fans! The Cities & Knights expansion adds another layer of complexity, and more tension. The 5-6 player expansions add yet another dimension to the game, with the addition of the ""special build"" reactionary phase. Seafarers seems to be suited for scenario play, but not much else. Initial rating: ""8"". Peaked at ""9"", briefly with the 5-6 player expansion.  Update (05/28/2009): 6 F2F plays. This is turning out to be a frustrating game, in terms of the trends in dice rolling. Some games are simply dominated by an preponderance of 5's, 9's, 10's... any number that I happen to NOT be on. Or it could go the other way; there have been games where several people sit around and cannot do anything, simply because the rolls are not coming up in the frequency that they should be based on statistics. Either the dice are funky (which mean don't play with the dice that came with the game), or this is just one of those things. The Law of Large Numbers indicates that eventually, EVENTUALLY, the dice will start rolling favorably. But this trough of bad luck could last most of the entire game, making play extremely frustrating. It may be time to start using the ""number cards"", because this is starting to break the game for me, as well as others. This is evidenced by the fact that most meetup members refuse to play this game because of its excessive randomness. Dropping to a ""7"".  Update (08/17/2010): Lately, it hasn't gotten the love it once engendered. Downgrading to a ""6"".  Update (12/21/2013): It has been 4.5 years since last play. It is a significant achievement in the world of board gaming, truly a ""classic"" in every meaning of the word right up there with Monopoly--a game that is even ""better"" than Monopoly. It was a great game for the period, but the group has moved on to greener pastures. It looks like the game doesn't have the legs we thought it had; since there is too much unmitigated randomness, it has alienated most of the veteran gamers I know. But, the design is a perfect blend of competition, negotiation/trading, randomness, and skill, with a very accessible rule set and game mechanics, I am sure it will continue to bring in and endear many new generations of board gamers to come. Still holding at a ""6"".  Update (03/13/2015): 7 F2F plays. Finally! After nearly six years, we played a 4-player, base Catan game! It's like a homecoming. We forgot some of the basic rules, but the fun was back. Nice, quick romp, just like Dominion--a classic that you never forget. Still a ""6""."|13|Catan

64780|ProfT|6.0|"I HATE Settlers.  Is it a bad game?  No, anything but.  Why then?  Becuase we played nothing else for *months* when our group first moved from MtG to board games.  Once every 6 months is fine for me.  So why do I dislike it so much?  In an ideal game everyone would have equal luck with the resources at an equal time during the game.  However, the game can be skewed so badly by one player getting their share of the luck early on in the game. Once that player or even those players are ahead it is very difficult to rein them in simply because if they have not been stupid with their expansion plans they will be getting resources more often than everyone else.  A good starting position while essential to win, in no way guarantees it.  How many 5 'n' 9's games have you had when you have been able to get a 6 and 8 for your starting villages.  Some randomness in games is a good thing, perfect information and grand strategy has it's place but for me the spice and seasoning is the little random events that make you re-think, re-evaluate and plan on the fly.  Settlers has far too much of that good thing.  It is a frustrating game for that reason with a lack of control to go with it.  Sure over time the skillful player will win more games in the same way that an expert backgammon player will beat the novice every time over a set of games.  Oh and heaven forbid that you as the unlucky one be adjacent to the ""leader"" in which case the robbers directed at them will happily sit on your resources as well.   Yes it is a great game that can simply bring new and innovative mechanics to an audience raised on the gaming hind teat that is monopoly and Clue(do).  Yes it has been hugely influential in the expansion of this hobby and yes I hve probably played this more than any other game that I own.   But there are better games.  Better games for gamers with more control ahd deeper thought; better gateway games for non-gamers with simpler rules and a more forgiving start.   Settlers will always have a place in my collection the trouble is twce a year is more than enough for it to hit the table. "|13|Catan

Without Settlers, board games would still be relegated to the toy aisle. I also realize that many people cut their Eurogame teeth on Catan and most of those who did are still absolutely loyal to it. I get it, but I still would rather play something else.  As one of the first Euro's to cross the pond, it often gets a free pass for the parts that don't always work. I'm not usually one to bitch about randomness, but I have had more than a couple of experiences where I've had to sit around for half an hour doing nothing because my territories simply would not produce. Again, I know that's just a dice thing and it's not likely to happen ALL of the time. It just seems to really irritate me when it does happen...and it always seems to ruin my experience.|13|Catan

I'll teach it if somebody really wants to learn it, but I tend to hang out with board game crowds where everyone either already knows it or already knows it's a little too random and pre-determined for them. I like to play with the traditional randomized board setup on a single, hexagonal island, with the dice chits in alphabetical order. I say this because there are lots of variants, even on the base game. I've also played the Cities & Knights expansion, and while that's more interesting, it's also too long without adding enough depth.

There's the opening strategy, the ongoing tactical decisions regarding route building, and -- of course -- the social aspect of trading.  I wish there were more ways to mitigate the luck, and just more in general, but this 23-year-old game certainly surprised us. "|13|Catan

64956|earthtone|6.0|(Not)* Gaming nirvana.  And it gets even better with Cities and Knights!  This game really shines with random hex and chit distribution.  I really love thinking about how to best exploit the limited resources on the map; and throwing down my roads, settlements, and cities in various winding and twisting configurations.  There's no need to worry if an opponent takes a spot I want as long as I set myself up in a good trade position, and not get tempted by the deceptive chits that whisper odds that may never play out.  It's a wheeling and dealing puzzly game where every move is a calculated gamble.  It's a pirate in a merchant's clothing, and I'm always up for a game.  2017 Update after owning the game for ten years: I hate the way you can trap people early in this game and they'll just sit there with nothing to do.  I also get kind of bored waiting for my resources to roll. It feels too slow, even when it goes fast.  *Ten'ish year update|13|Catan

65031|revengeisnotjustice|6.0|I always find this game exciting.  Catan, more than almost any other game I play, makes me feel like I'm building a little civilization. I feel such pride when I build a road, or when I put up a new settlement.  It's also quite exhilarating to roll the exact number needed to get the resource that you need just as it's devestating to roll a seven when you've got a hand full of cards.  With as many times as I've played this game (I got it before I started keep close numbers on my play stats), I still enjoy it a lot.  The only thing that I find frustrating is the dice rolling.  If Catan had no dice, and instead had some other way of allocating resources, it would possible be in my top ten.  Instead, it's a game that I play sometimes because it's a classic and because it's a game that I discovered fairly early on in my development from game enjoyer to game enthusiast.    ***Update***  I haven't played Catan in months because I'm just not that interested in it now that I've passed the gateway stage.  The dice just bother me so much that I never take it out and play it.  Rating lowered to a six.|13|Catan

65146|DOAisBetter|6.0|Really luck based, but so much fun. The main problem with this game is after you start playing with expansions you really can't go back. I won't play this ever again without the fisherman expansion at the very least, although Seafarers or Cities would be preferred.|13|Catan

65154|Sops|6.0|Had very mixed experiences with this, and it's not really lived up to the hype... (perhaps for me Carcassonne did the gateway thing?) - sometimes it just seems to take forever and be just boring, for some reason... other times, pretty quick and fun, even with more players. Like it in the main, but I just wish it was a bit more consistent for me - or I was a bit more consistent for it, perhaps...?  EDIT: Bumped up a bit since the 6 rating of Jan 2010, as it deserves more than that, not least for the game with the kids where we got real fruit for successful trading, but it's still not the best game, I think, and is a bit slow to get going perhaps? Takes too long to do much. |13|Catan

65209|bippi|6.0|I've played this on various computer games, and it's always bored the living whiz out of me.  ALWAYS.  But, hundreds of thousands of copies sold can't be wrong, right?  EDIT:  Played this and had a great time.  It did run a little long even for as reasonably streamlined as our turns were, but that was nothing that couldn't be solved by say, playing to 8 rather than 10.  What I really liked about it, is if I had to come up with one game that encompassed all that it meant to be a game, with negotiation, strategy, and luck in all equal parts...  this would be that game.  08-15-11:  This game always takes just a hair longer than it aught to.  It's probably me that causes it, too.  In the end though, I'd rather play almost anything else.  Oh, and grind the development stack.  You can't go wrong.  SOLD.  09-18-11:  I think one of the things about this game going too long, is that it's a bit of a fractal representation of everyone on the board.  That is, the story doesn't really ever arc even as a winner is emerging.  People still trade, because it's helping their individual positions anyway.  The guy on the board who is getting the most shit, will find a way to get even more shit just as well getting his 10th point as he is getting his 7th point.|13|Catan

65309|hend|6.0|2-21-10 Lowered my rating from an 8 to a 6 now that I've played both ways (randomizing the board and playing the 'beginner' setup). I realize this game isn't as much fun as I once hoped.  It's too random as to who is getting which resources, you can't really get any type of momentum going unless the dice are in your favor.  You can trade, sure, but if you have the same junk everyone else wants, you're out of luck.  You can get built in if other people are able to expand faster than you, and it can get to the point in a 4-player game where one or two people get 'eliminated' by the halfway mark of the game.  It takes too long for the level of depth.  Two hours for this game is absurd!  There needs to be more points in the deck as otherwise it's just not a wise investment.  Too many knight cards.  The social aspect of the game is fun but the game itself doesn't feel much more fun than games like Monopoly, because really, if you don't get the dice rolls and don't have the right stuff to trade, you lose - just like Monopoly.  At least in Monopoly when you get to the point where you know you can't win, you can just trade away your money and properties and go do something fun.  Here you get stuck being useless until somebody finally gets 10 points.|13|Catan

I stand by what I said before, but this one is starting to show its gateway status for me.  There are deeper titles on my shelf more worthy of play.  Update: Bumping down to 6.

It seems that some times, it can be very hard to get the 13 points and the game can last way too long (3 hours...) Barbarians are cool feature, but being hit by them slow the game donw, and is probbaly a losse for the player being hit. May be not for noobs...  Main issue is that most of the game is played when you first put your buildings on the board...

I can honestly say that I have never had anyone DISLIKE this game after playing it.  It's usually they're first REAL boardgame and it ends up being the best one they've ever played. Edit (2/4/13):  I've changed my ranking from a 9 to a 6.  I've grown so tired of this game that I cringe when someone suggests it.  It is a good game, but there are so many better games that I can't believe we're still playing this as a group.   |13|Catan

65523|JohnRayJr|6.0|"IIRC, I first played Settlers in 2006. Played 2-3 times, tops. There was some curiosity about modern boardgaming, so I thought I'd get a companion game to Settlers for the group, which ultimately ended up being Carcassonne. In other words, I pulled a standard Gateway maneuver many years after these two games were released, but I left Settlers behind so quickly it never made an impression on me. I played a lot of Carc (about 20 sessions), but half of that was at the request of more casual, non-gamer friends. So they responded to the ""gateway game"" while I was off and running.   I say all of this because I came back to Settlers recently (10/28/09) for one session just to see how it would strike me as a died-in-the-wool, hardcore gamer. I don't have any nostalgia for this game. I never experienced it as the only game in town or as the forerunner of a whole movement.   So to me, in 2009, Settlers is a distinctive but fairly unengaging game. In essence, the game is built around a random distribution of goods that is, in theory, corrected by manipulation of the odds and player negotiation. In practice neither of these things really do enough for the game. It does play quickly and simply. I've also read that 4-player Settlers is inevitably ""an exercise in futility for one player, an exercise in false hope for another, and a real contest between the other two."" That's been my experience as well.   As gateway games go: TtR < Settlers < Carc < Pandemic. Althought as a cooperative, Pandemic doesn't really introduce people to the mainstream. "|13|Catan

65591|balijan2|6.0|"2005-2006-ban a Carcassone mellett ez volt a másik játék, amit az ""újabbak"" közt volt szerencsém kipróbálni (új alatt azt értem, hogy nem activity és társai). Rám a kettő közül ez volt nagyobb hatással. Számomra addig ismeretlen elemek (pl. az alkudozás, a nyersanyagszerzési mód, stb.) nagyon színessé és vonzóvá tették a játékot, annak ellenére, hogy nem igazán voltam benne jó. Mára kicsit megkopott a varázsa, sok jobbat láttam már, de most is szívesen játszanék fele, főleg hogy van egy kiegem, amit még nem próbáltam! --- Kipróbáltam a kieggel is. Nos nem rossz játék ez a Catan, de így hogy több mint 400 féle játékot ismerek, azt mondom, hogy vannak abból az időszakból olyanok, amik sokkal jobban kiállták az idő próbáját (El Grande, Tigris, Hannibál), bár a felsoroltak mindegyike eleve komolyabb játék, mint ez. Ma már csak nosztalgikus okokból ülök le a Catanhoz. --- Újra előkerült, ebből is látszik, hogy még ennyi játék ismeretében sem zárkózom el tőle, de azért már nem az a megkerülhetetlen játék, ami 10 éve volt. Tegnap 2 partit játszottunk, és 10-8-4 ill. 10-4-4 lett az eredmény kb. azonos képességű játékosok közt (nem mindkétszer ugyanaz nyert, és nem is pont ugyanaz volt a játékosok összetétele). Ha az induló 2-2-2 pontokat nem számoljuk, akkor 8-6-2 illetve 8-2-2 a végeredmény. Az első parti másfél óra volt, a második 1 óra. Több játékossal simán lehet 2 óra feletti a játék, ehhez képest nevetségesen nagy a végeredményben mutatkozó különbség. A második partiban fél óra elteltével látszott, hogy ki lesz a győztes, és nem lehetett ellene mit tenni. Szerintem többek közt ezért áldozott le egy kicsit a Catan csillaga. De nosztalgiának továbbra is jöhet, csak fenntartásokkal fogom kezelni."|13|Catan

65631|PhygLeGuy|6.0|Willing to play when welcoming newbies to the room. Need to engage in active trading to appreciate this game. Need to play this several times in order to make productive trades. If I'm going to play something several times, I'd prefer another game.  Overall, a decent gateway, and still a clever use of dice. There's a potential for disaster if some of the players have no grasp of the distribution of 2d6.  EDIT: Thoughts as of 2012. Have you ever noticed just how long it takes to explain this, for a so-called gateway game? Also, it's been around so long that many folks seems to have learned it third- or fourth-hand, which is to say that many unintended house rules have mutated into the gene pool. Earns nostalgia points for having brought many of us into the designer-name-on-the-box world. |13|Catan

I dont want to be too harsh on it, I still enjoy the game and play it periodically.  You just have to take it for what it is.  A GREAT way to show others that boardgames dont have to be Candyland or Monopoly.  Re-rated from a 5 to a 6, based on the fact that I like this game, I Have a soft spot for it, and Ill usually play when asked and enjoy it win or lose.  This game will always be in my collection.|13|Catan
