37|cfarrell|10.0|THE classic game of the 90's. Belongs in every game collection. I still play this fairly often - just the basic game alone has surely cracked 100 plays, and throw in all the variants and expansions and this is an incredible system. --- Version Notes: Overall, I think the 2005-ish re-issue of Die Siedler von Catan from Kosmos - featuering plastic pieces - is the most attractive, funcational version of the game. It has bright, pleasing graphics, the smaller resource cards are easy to manage, and the plastic inserts are the most functional inserts ever for a game. It is in German, though. But every version has its charms, even going back to the borderline-ugly Mayfair 1st and 2nd printings (the ones that used photos - I don't actually own either of those printings, but I'd like to just to add to my collection). The 2007 Mayfair edition (the bigger box) is probably the nicest version that Mayfair has done, and is comparable and even superior in some ways to the 2005 Kosmos edition, the first time Mayfair has gone their own way  and done something at least as good as Kosmos. It also has the advantage of being in English. I generally like Mayfair's 3rd printing better than most players - I think it's a nice, distinct set with its own flavor apart from the other versions - but I'd also agree that it's overall not as graphically effective as the other versions, being a little dark.|13|Catan

41|andy hart|10.0|So, it's a ten then. I hate to have to go with the crowd, but after several years playing, it's still one of the first games to come out during a session. Yes, there's a certain ammount of luck (I once won a game becuase the dice simply WOULD NOT stop coming up 4's. Guess who had 4) but it's usually up to the individual players as to what use they make out of their resources. An real winner. |13|Catan

48|nadle|10.0|The best game invented in the last decade. With the changeable tileset and the trading system you don't get hardly boring. Also the subject reponds of one's desire: everyone wants to seek their fortune in the unexplored world. We've played once with ten players with two games and a 5&6 player expansion. Great fun.|13|Catan

71|Don Quixote|10.0|This game single handedly started my board game addiction back in the fall of 2002.  A must for any game player.|13|Catan
72|krystrandya|10.0|I am so glad this game exists.  Fun.  It's for the random folks who game.  Playable with folks who want to be gamers, but really like a bit more light fare.  The dice are the deciding factor.  I sware.. put everything on 9, it's better than 6/8 in our games :).  It reminds me of gambling a lot.  Hard if there is someone who gets seriously.. painfully beaten each time because the dot discussion on probabilities is a bit too much for them.  So.. in a certain group, it's great.  I still love it for certain groups.  |13|Catan
73|JoaoPPP19|10.0|Simply the best boardgame of all time. THE PERFECT game. It&#039;s impossible to have better. Klaus Teuber is the boardgame genious of the century. He must have one place in history. This game, in a scale of 1 to 10, deserves 12.|13|Catan

78|Dayv|10.0|Quite simply, this is the best and most elegant board game I have ever played.  I have hooked many of my friends on it over the last six years, many of them not people one would describe as game fans in general.  Its appeal is broad, and I have never grown tired of it.|13|Catan

80|Savage|10.0||13|Catan
81|Hrothgarrr|10.0|                     Probably the best and most balanced four player game ever. Settlers defines simplicity in game play, which leads to wins by more than a few folks new to the game over more established players. The mechanics are a blend of sheer dumb luck, careful strategy, and some real good smak. I am the sheep king...baaaah........|13|Catan

Bring out any of the expansions, however, and I&#039;ll play anywhere, anytime!!  This is one of the few dice games that I really enjoy.  It&#039;s very exciting when you have a hand full of cards and you are praying that no one rolls a 7, or you have 2 cities on a 9 wheat field and a 9 is rolled!!!  Brilliant game by a brilliant game designer.|13|Catan

100|Eric Brosius|10.0|"This is an excellent game as a game, but it also has a social interaction component that few games offer.  My favorite Settlers story comes from my friend Andy, who played a game in which all his opponents were extremely agreeable when it came to trading (""anyone trade me a sheep and a wood for a wood?  I need a sheep?""  ""Sure!"")  He was way too smart to do this.  Halfway through the game he realized he was hopelessly behind...  We always call this game ""Settlers"", but you can't find it using the Search function on BGG if you type in ""Settlers"".  It's stupid."|13|Catan

This is a real game that I can get non-gamers to play.  The existence of this game has saved me from playing annoying party games with non-gamers time and time again, hence the ""+1""."|13|Catan

After we played out all 3 games as is, we tried many variations found online (including 2 that i bought on Ebay) &amp; ideas that we came up with ourselves. Practically each game is a brand new game. Any one version might not stand up on it&#039;s own to Puerto Rico (getting it this week), but the possibilities kept us busy for a year once a week. Also, my 8 year old son understands this game (not enough to win though).  10/15/03 haven&#039;t played in monthes but feeling still the same.|13|Catan

184|Gordon the Green|10.0|The Settlers of Catan may well be the single greatest board game ever designed. Like many other German games, it combines simple rules and a short playing time with the potential for intricate strategy and battles of wits. But Catan is arguably the best example of bringing all these elements into perfect balance.  Catan satisfies a wide range of people, even those who normally hate board games, since it is the players themselves that choose the character of each game. It can be as cutthroat or as amiable as you want (or both!). It also excels at keeping every player actively involved at all times, both through the ingenious system of resource production and the constant opportunities for trading and deal-making. I could go on, but others already have.  I have no hesitation in recommending Settlers of Catan to pretty much anyone. From there, you may choose to explore more complex or more simple-structure games, but Catan is good for all! |13|Catan

208|andrewh63|10.0|Such a simple game but yet you have so many decisions.  I played this with my friend Lyman and immediately saw the potential for a great game.  I brought one copy to the gaming group and started the whole trend.  I ended up contacting a German MTG player who arranged to shipped about a dozen copies of the game plus the 5-6 expansion kit to our group.  This was before German game was avail in the US. I have one very beat up copy and one unopened copy.  Both of them are Kosmo(red box) edition.|13|Catan

I never knew games like Settlers existed until GenCon in 1997.  I played it a ton (many, many times before I started logging plays on BGG), and taught it to so many friends that I got sick of teaching the rules.  Even though it rarely sees the table these days, I still put it in my own personal Hall of Fame, and therefore rate it a 10."|13|Catan

341|GamesWeLove|10.0|A classic!  Spent many sleepless nights at Denny's with friends over this game.  Played it since the first Mayfair English version came out.  I'm glad to see that it is finally catching on to the mainstream gaming community!  Bit too much luck is involved with the dice rolls at times, but the game is well balanced over time.  Loved by my guy friends and gal friends, gamers and non-gamers alike.  Scoring is simple, and almost every game everyone gets the feeling that they are somewhat close to winning.  Perhaps not the best game ever made in the modern time, but definitely the first of the best that opened the door for many more to come -- for that, it deserves a 10!|13|Catan

410|Gordon|10.0|Played 200+ A lovely social game. The robber reigns in the leader helping to create a close game. There is nearly no down time. Card trading is friendly. How well players are doing is clear to see. The excitement builds as the game reaches its conclusion. The board changes making every play unique. This is an excellent game with the added bonus that it appeals to both the sexes. Mar 05|13|Catan

419|SteveK2|10.0|A venerable classic to some people, to me it’s a relatively recently discovered game that led to many other new games.  Simple, involving, different each play. A game where luck is a virtue, forcing trading, attention to hand-limits and use (& defence against) the blocking robber.  A gateway game that’s a wonderful destination in its own right.  While the basic game is a 10, almost every expansion adds complexity or downtime, and reduces the rating.|13|Catan
420|Wes Makin|10.0|Even though seeing what part of the bell curve is going to implode has too strong of an impact on the game, I'm still rating this a ten.

425|djflippy|10.0|"Settlers is an absolute classic. It is one of my personal favorites and it is the ""gateway game"" that allowed me to bring countless new players into gaming. It is the quintessential resource management game. It uses a tile-laying mechanism similar to that of [gameid=58], which ensures a different board layout every game. Players then populate this map with settlements to obtain resources like wood and stone that can be used to build more structures and roads. There are several routes to victory and discovering different strategies and other subtleties of play ensures a high replayability factor. Most importantly, it gives players the opportunity to ask the age-old question, ""Do you have wood for sheep?"""|13|Catan

439|Outside Lime|10.0|The introductory Euro-game for me and the one which has achieved the best penetration amongst my non-gaming friends. Evidence: We hosted a Settlers tourney at our house with 24 players, and none of those people with the exception of myself owns a game invented since 1980.  Settlers has many attractive elements to it. The easy lingo, the constant engagement created by the resource-generation system, and the cute little network that you build are some standout features that are very appreciated by new players.  |13|Catan

She does admit this probably wasn't a great idea.  There is a lot of luck in the rolls, and no game is complete without everyone constantly whining about bad rolls.  Someone on BBG calls the game ""Whiners of Catan,"" and ain't it the truth!  As soon as someone stops whining, it's time to start stealing from them."|13|Catan

452|Mr Lookback|10.0|Considered by many as one of the premiere “gateway” games, this is the title that got me into the much broader and deeper world of board games so, it holds a special place in my heart. Players are settling the world of Catan by trading resources and building settlements, cities and roads to be the first player to achieve the number of points needed to win the game. Easy, elegant, quick to pick up and explain and, of course, fun to play!  Trading and strategically placing key roads and buildings are well balanced. A must for any game household!|13|Catan

I have been gaming for over 20 years and this is a ""must have"" for every strategic gamer. "|13|Catan
468|Shaun L|10.0|The modular board and trading are fantastic mechanics for replayability and player interaction. Settlers provides a nice balance between long-term planning and randomness. Its always a thrill to have your cities start producing after clawing your way forward in the early game.   I've always preferred vanilla Settlers to the expansions. For a so-called gateway game Settlers has a LOT of rules. Adding in expansions doesn't seem like a productive way to recruit new board game enthusiasts. Why complicate a fantastic game when you can pull out any number of other games that will introduce new mechanics?  ASIDE: I also have the Korean version (카탄), which is basically the Kosmos version. However, the new plastic mold pieces were missing from the box! If only I knew who to contact. Kosmos did not reply to my email. Oh well.|13|Catan

Now that I'm enlightened, I guess there really isn't much more to say about it that hasn't already been said (by its advocates).  I will say, however, that comments that this game is random reek of more ignorance than just about any other stereotypical BGG comment.  I guess this is yet another example of a game whose ultimate pay-off has turned out to be inversely proportional to my original dislike of the game (Ra, Dune, Antiquity being a few others).|13|Catan

SoC's blend of building, trading, and conquering new territory is amazingly engaging for most people.

Even 15 years on there are still no better games out there. Why?  First would be that every game is different, right from the start.  The modular board presents the players with a significantly different challenge each time - not many games do that.  Second, there is very little downtime.
